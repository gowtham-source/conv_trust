Based on your preferences, I recommend checking out 'The Name of the Wind' by Patrick Rothfuss (epic fantasy with a touch of mystery), 'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell' by Susanna Clarke (historical fantasy), and 'Dune' by Frank Herbert (sci-fi with world-building similar to epic fantasy). For historical fiction, have you read 'The Nightingale' by Kristin Hannah? It's quite popular. Do any of those pique your interest?",

      "utterance": "You are correct, the third book in 'The Kingkiller Chronicle' is not yet released. The magic system in 'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell' is quite different from the Cosmere. It's based more on the history and practice of magic in 19th-century England, with a focus on rituals and scholarly research rather than explicitly defined rules. It's a much slower, more atmospheric story. Given that, would you like me to provide alternative recommendations?",
