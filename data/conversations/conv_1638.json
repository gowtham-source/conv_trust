Specific foods known for immune-boosting properties include citrus fruits (vitamin C), garlic (allicin), and foods rich in antioxidants like berries and leafy greens. You could also look into taking a multivitamin, but it's best to confirm with your doctor first. Also, drink enough water. Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods as much as possible. I could find some more specific examples of food items.",

As for cheap and easy options, maybe try incorporating frozen vegetables into your diet? They're just as nutritious as fresh ones, and they're usually very affordable and you can just throw them in the microwave.",
