Based on popular choices and recent customer reviews in the 'Running Shoes' category, I recommend the following:\n\n*   **Nike Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT%:** A top-tier racing shoe.\n*   **Brooks Ghost 14:** A well-cushioned, neutral trainer.\n*   **Hoka Bondi 8:** Known for its maximal cushioning.\n\nDo any of those sound interesting, or should I narrow it down further based on your needs (e.g., distance, pronation type, etc.)?",

Ultraboost has a responsive boost foam.\n*   **Support:** Ghost 14 offers good support for neutral runners. Ultraboost also performs well in this regard.\n*   **Durability:** Both shoes are quite durable, but the specific wear and tear really depend on your running style and usage.\n\nBasically, it depends on what you want. The Ghost might be better for all-day comfort, while the Ultraboost might be more 'peppy'. I can provide more specific comparisons if you want.",
