'Frostpunk' has survival city-building with narrative choices that feel impactful like an RPG. 'Crusader Kings III' is a grand strategy game with strong character RPG elements. 'Kenshi' is a unique sandbox RPG with base-building. These aren't traditional RPGs but mix genres in interesting ways.",

      "utterance": "Ah, I understand the distinction better now. You're looking for RPGs primarily, where management/strategy is a core system rather than the primary genre. That's a challenging combination! 'Pathfinder: Kingmaker' and 'Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous' have kingdom/crusade management as significant side systems within a classic isometric RPG structure. 'ActRaiser Renaissance' is an interesting modern take on an old game that mixes action-platforming with city-building simulation. These might be closer to what you envision.",
