      "utterance": "I understand your frustration when symptoms persist despite trying common remedies. While low iron (anemia) can indeed cause fatigue and headaches, it's important to confirm the cause before starting supplementation. Taking iron supplements when you don't need them can potentially lead to health issues or interfere with other medications or supplements you might be taking. Diagnosing a deficiency requires a blood test ordered by a doctor. Therefore, it's not advisable to start taking iron supplements based solely on online information about your symptoms. Self-treating can be risky. It's best to consult a healthcare professional who can properly evaluate your symptoms, consider your medical history, and order appropriate tests if necessary.",

While I cannot provide medical advice on *when* you personally should seek care, general guidelines suggest seeing a doctor for headaches that are new, unusually severe, accompanied by other symptoms like fever, stiff neck, confusion, vision changes, numbness, weakness, or that worsen over time or after a head injury. Given yours is persistent and affecting your daily life, a medical evaluation would be a prudent step to identify the cause.",
