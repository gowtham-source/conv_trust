A 'Service Fee Adjustment' can sometimes occur due to various factors, such as prorated changes from a plan modification, specific usage exceeding standard limits, or promotional periods ending. It's not a hidden fee but reflects a change based on account activity. Looking at your account, it seems related to a recent change in your service tier. We can review the specifics together if you'd like, or I can provide documentation explaining this charge.",
