For around $100, your options are limited, but you *might* be able to find a slightly used or refurbished pair of the Sony WH-CH700N. Alternatively, the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 is a popular choice with good noise cancellation and is often under $60. Would you like me to check current prices and availability for each?",

I'm showing no readily available WH-CH700N models at that price point. Regarding noise cancellation: The ATH-ANC70 generally has a *slightly* better noise cancellation performance than the Anker Q20, especially for consistent, low-frequency sounds. However, the Anker is still very good for the price. It depends on your specific needs and preferences.",

Think of it this way: the Audio-Technica might be able to cancel out the hum of an airplane engine a little more effectively, whereas the Anker might let in a bit more of that sound. For most typical office or home environments, the Anker will still perform admirably.  I recommend reading some reviews on both product pages to get a feel for people's experiences.",
