If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 ft/sec, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall? Let's start with the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides. Do you want me to show you the steps, or would you like to work through it?",

      "utterance": "Yes, your answer is correct. And regarding the negative sign, it indicates the rate of change is decreasing. If the ladder was sliding towards the wall, the value of dx/dt would be negative, thus the answer for dy/dt would turn out to be positive, indicating the ladder is moving upward. Does that make sense? Also, the negative sign in the first case is because the height is decreasing as the bottom slides away. It's related to the direction of movement along the y-axis.",
