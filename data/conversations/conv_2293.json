If the ladder was sliding towards the wall, the value of dx/dt would be negative, thus the answer for dy/dt would turn out to be positive, indicating the ladder is moving upward. Does that make sense? Also, the negative sign in the first case is because the height is decreasing as the bottom slides away. It's related to the direction of movement along the y-axis.",
