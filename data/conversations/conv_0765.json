As for ROI, it's difficult to predict a specific return. It depends heavily on the investment type, market conditions, and your risk tolerance. With $500, you could consider investing in low-cost index funds or ETFs. Historical data shows average annual returns of around 7-10% for the S&P 500, but past performance is not indicative of future results. It is important to remember this.
