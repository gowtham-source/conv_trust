Based on your budget of $150, I recommend the following noise-canceling headphones:\n\n*   **Sony WH-CH720N:** Often found within your budget and offer excellent noise cancellation for the price.\n*   **Anker Soundcore Space Q45:** A great value pick with solid performance.\n*   **Technics EAH-AZ80:** If you can stretch your budget just a bit, these are excellent.\n\nWould you like to know more about any of these?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! Generally, the Sony WH-CH720N offers a more balanced sound profile with slightly better clarity in the mid-range frequencies, which can make vocals and instruments sound more natural. The Anker Soundcore Q45 may have a bit more emphasis on bass, which some users prefer, but the Sony headphones often have a wider soundstage. The Sony's sound quality is better on average. However, sound quality is subjective, and it depends on your listening preferences. The Anker Q45 has active noise cancelling, a long battery life, and is easier on the wallet.",
