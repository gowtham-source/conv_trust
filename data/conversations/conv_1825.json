      "utterance": "That's a great question! Generally, the Sony WH-CH720N offers a more balanced sound profile with slightly better clarity in the mid-range frequencies, which can make vocals and instruments sound more natural. The Anker Soundcore Q45 may have a bit more emphasis on bass, which some users prefer, but the Sony headphones often have a wider soundstage. The Sony's sound quality is better on average. However, sound quality is subjective, and it depends on your listening preferences. The Anker Q45 has active noise cancelling, a long battery life, and is easier on the wallet.",
