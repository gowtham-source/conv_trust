      "utterance": "That's a good question! High fantasy is often used to describe any fantasy that takes place in a separate world, as opposed to urban fantasy, which occurs in our world. Epic fantasy is a subgenre that emphasizes a grand scope, often with world-altering stakes, multiple points of view, and significant length. In practice, the terms are often used interchangeably, especially by the public. Epic fantasy is probably more popular, but both are extremely popular, with plenty of crossover. Does that clear things up?",
