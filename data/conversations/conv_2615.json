My recommendations are based on processing and analyzing information from a vast dataset of text, including summaries, reviews, genre classifications, and common themes, to find patterns and relevant titles. To provide more tailored suggestions, could you tell me what aspects of hard sci-fi you enjoy most? Is it the scientific accuracy, the focus on technology, or the exploration of potential future societies?",
