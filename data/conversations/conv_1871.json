Generally, if a contract is ambiguous, the courts often interpret it against the party who drafted it. However, relying solely on a poorly written agreement as your defense could be risky. It's important to consider all angles. I can search for legal precedent in similar cases if you want, but remember that I am an AI and cannot provide legal advice. You should definitely seek legal counsel for an in-depth review of your case.",
