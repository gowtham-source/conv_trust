Then, thoroughly clean the walls to remove any dirt or grease. After that, use painter's tape to protect trim, windows, and door frames. Finally, apply a primer if necessary, especially if you're painting over a dark color or bare drywall. How does that sound?",

Applying primer will ensure better adhesion of the new paint, give you a more uniform color, and potentially save you from needing multiple coats of the gray paint. It also helps block stains. If you want the best possible result, priming is a worthwhile investment of your time. Does that make sense?",
