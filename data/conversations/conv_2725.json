For lo-fi or dreamy indie, you might like artists such as Beach Fossils, Alvvays, or maybe even some earlier Pavement? Determining genre boundaries can indeed be complex as artists evolve and blend styles. Generally, 'indie rock' refers to bands associated with independent record labels or maintaining an independent ethos, often with diverse sounds that distinguish them from major-label rock.",
