If there's a significant difference, you may need to buy longer supply lines. Regarding the base plate, can you provide the make and model of the faucet? Some manufacturers offer different base plates or trim kits. Without that information, I can't give you more specific advice, but maybe you should consider the implications of the local plumbing codes or if the faucet has a different thread type than your supply valves. It might not be as easy as it seems, and might be best left to the professionals. Would you like me to help you find a local plumber?",
