My budget is pretty strict, ideally under $50 an item, maybe a bit more for something like a jacket. I like a fairly simple, classic style, nothing too trendy. It's just hard to find things that look decent without spending a fortune.",

For casual, classic styles under $50 per item, I'd recommend looking at fast-fashion retailers known for basics, checking out sale sections in department stores, or exploring online marketplaces that might offer lower prices.

      "utterance": "That's a very valid concern. Determining quality on a budget can be tricky. Look at the fabric composition â€“ natural fibers or blends often feel better and can last longer than 100% synthetic, low-grade materials. Check seams for loose threads or uneven stitching. Read online reviews if available, and see if the store has a reasonable return policy in case the item doesn't hold up.",
