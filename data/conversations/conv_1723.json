Within a $150 budget, you could consider a few options: a jumpsuit from ASOS (they often have good sales), a well-chosen dress from a place like Lulus, or a skirt and top combination from stores like H&M or Zara. I will give you some links to potential options. However, this might take a little longer to get the links so stay tuned.",

Regarding sizing, I cannot know your exact measurements, however, I can provide sizing guides from the stores I suggest. For alterations, you'll need to factor that cost into your budget and find a local tailor. I would advise buying something that requires minimal alterations to save money. Give me a few more minutes to generate those links for you.",
