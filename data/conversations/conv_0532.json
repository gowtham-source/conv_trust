How about some classic white sneakers like Adidas Stan Smiths or Veja V-10s? Alternatively, a pair of leather Chelsea boots could also work well. Finally, boat shoes could also work.

You can also add a casual jacket like a bomber or a denim jacket. The key is to balance the sporty shoes with more polished pieces. Avoid wearing them with athletic shorts or overly sporty clothing.",

These are easier to pair with different outfits than a bright neon color. As for finding them at a good price, I would suggest checking sites like Zappos, Nordstrom Rack, and Amazon. You can also use price comparison tools like Google Shopping to see which retailer currently has the best deal.",
