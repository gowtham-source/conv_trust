For Java, consider the `ListNode` class (if you're using one). Here are some key steps for you to think about: 1) Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the list. 2) Iterate through the list while `fast` and `fast.next` are not null. 3) In each iteration, move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward. 4) If `slow` and `fast` meet at any point, there is a cycle. Otherwise, if fast reaches null, there is no cycle. Give that a shot and tell me what you come up with!",
