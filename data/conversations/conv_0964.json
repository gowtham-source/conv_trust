For example, if the project led to fewer errors and saved time, you could estimate the time saved per week and extrapolate that into a monthly or yearly figure. As for the skills section, focus on relevance. Listing every software you've used might dilute your qualifications. Prioritize the tools and technologies that are most frequently mentioned in the job descriptions and that you're proficient in. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the requirements.",
