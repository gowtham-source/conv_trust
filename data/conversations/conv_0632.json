It's a highly-rated, manual pour-over system that's easy to use and produces excellent coffee. Alternatively, if you're open to drip coffee makers, the Bonavita Connoisseur is consistently praised for its ability to mimic the pour-over process and falls within your price range. Which one sounds more appealing?",

While any plastic *could* potentially leach at extremely high temperatures and over very long periods, the Bonavita is designed to operate at safe temperatures, and the risk is considered negligible by most users and independent testing organizations. We haven't received significant complaints about that. Would you like me to provide links to some customer reviews that might address this concern?",
