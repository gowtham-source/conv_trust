One moment while I filter based on average user reviews and price. Okay, I found the 'Hotel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e'. It's a 5-star hotel and has excellent reviews, but it may be outside of your budget. There is also 'Shangri-La Hotel, Paris' available. I am unsure if that location is ideal for you, however.",

I can show you the specific cancellation policy for each rate offered if you'd like. I'll gather those details.",
