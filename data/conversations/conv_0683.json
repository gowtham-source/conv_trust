Even if you haven't explicitly used 'agile marketing methodologies,' consider whether you've worked in fast-paced environments, adapted quickly to changing priorities, or collaborated closely with cross-functional teams. These are all hallmarks of agile. Can you think of any specific projects where you demonstrated these qualities? Try using keywords like 'iterative approach,' 'collaborative campaigns,' or 'data-driven decision making' when describing your contributions.",
