For the 'Service Not Covered' denial, this often indicates that the payer requires pre-authorization, or there might be a frequency limitation exceeded. Let's check Smith's insurance policy details to see if pre-authorization is needed for physical therapy services and also verify if a frequency limitation has been reached. Also, let's double-check the appropriate modifier for 97110 with that payer.",

I don't have direct access to comparative denial rate data between different insurance companies due to privacy regulations and the variability of such data. However, you can often find this information through your state's insurance regulatory agency, or by consulting industry benchmarking reports from organizations like the AMA or MGMA. They often publish reports detailing payer performance. In the meantime, focusing on resolving the modifier issue with the 97110 code is likely the most immediate path to getting the claim paid. Are you using the GP modifier? That's commonly used for physical therapy.",
