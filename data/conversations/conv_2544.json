Given your need for over-ear, noise-cancelling headphones for commuting within the $150-$250 budget, here are a few popular options you might consider:\n\n1.  **Sony WH-CH720N:** Often falls within this range, known for good ANC and comfort.\n2.  **Anker Soundcore Space Q45:** Popular for strong noise cancellation relative to its price point.\n3.  **Sennheiser ACCENTUM Plus:** Sometimes available closer to the upper end of your budget, offers good sound quality and decent ANC.\n\nYou can click on each product to see more details and read reviews.",

The Anker Space Q45 is frequently recommended in that price bracket because it offers a very competitive level of noise cancellation compared to *other* headphones in the $150-250 range, even if it doesn't match premium models. It's often highlighted for its performance *for the cost*. We can refine the search. Would you prefer to prioritize comfort or perhaps look at models known for slightly better build quality, even if the ANC is just 'good' rather than 'very strong' for the price?",

For more in-depth analysis, I recommend checking the 'Reviews' section on the product page, especially video reviews that demonstrate ANC in real-world scenarios like commuting. Regarding returns, our standard return policy generally allows returns within 30 days for most electronics if they are in original condition. However, specific conditions or restocking fees might apply depending on the item and reason for return. Please refer to the 'Returns & Refunds' page linked in the footer for the most accurate and detailed information specific to this purchase.",
