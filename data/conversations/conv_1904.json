You can often find great cocktail dresses and separates within your price range. For shoes, consider checking out DSW or even Target, where you can find stylish options. I can search for specific items for you if you give me a few details like your size and preferred colors.",

Based on your preferences, I found a few options: a knee-length emerald green dress from ASOS for $60 (currently on sale), a pair of navy blue block heels from DSW for $40, and a simple clutch from Target for $20. This leaves you with about $80 for accessories like earrings or a bracelet. Do these recommendations seem appealing, or would you like me to refine the search based on different criteria?",
