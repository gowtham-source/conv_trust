Possible causes include a lingering cold or flu, bronchitis, allergies, or even acid reflux. Less commonly, it could indicate something more serious. To give you more specific advice, could you tell me if you've had a fever, body aches, or any shortness of breath? Also, are you a smoker, or do you have any known allergies or pre-existing conditions?",

However, given the shortness of breath, even if mild, and the persistent nature of your symptoms, I strongly recommend consulting with a doctor for a proper diagnosis. It could still be allergy-related, but it's important to rule out other potential causes like a respiratory infection or even asthma. They will be able to run tests and provide you with the most accurate assessment and treatment plan.",
