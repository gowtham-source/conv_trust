Then, if oxygen is present, the pyruvate enters the mitochondria and goes through the Krebs cycle and then the electron transport chain. Do you want to try explaining it back to me?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! The electron transport chain (ETC) is where most of the ATP is produced. Electrons, carried by molecules like NADH and FADH2, are passed down a series of protein complexes. As electrons move down the chain, protons (H+) are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient then drives ATP synthase, which produces ATP. Does that make sense?",
