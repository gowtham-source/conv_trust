Let it dry thoroughly according to the manufacturer's instructions, then sand it smooth to be level with the existing wall surface before priming. For very deep or wide scratches, multiple thin layers of compound are better than one thick layer to prevent cracking. Remember to use a sanding sponge or fine-grit sandpaper to avoid damaging the surrounding texture.",
