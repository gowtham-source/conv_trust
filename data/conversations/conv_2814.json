Some popular over-ear options in that price range include the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x, Sony WH-CH510, and Koss Porta Pro (though these are on-ear, not strictly over-ear, they're a common budget pick). They offer varying sound profiles and features.",

Also, are any of these *actually* comfortable for long periods? I had a cheap pair before and they hurt my ears after 30 minutes! I'm kind of annoyed I wasted money last time and want something decent this time.",

      "utterance": "Apologies for the slight confusion with the Sony WH-CH510 model description - it is indeed an on-ear model, not over-ear. Thank you for catching that! Comfort is a big factor, and unfortunately, budget headphones can sometimes sacrifice padding or clamping force quality. Among the truly over-ear options under $100, the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x is generally considered decent for comfort for its price, though subjective. Comfort often improves significantly as you move into slightly higher price ranges, but within the sub-$100 over-ear category, the M20x is a frequent recommendation for its balance of sound and build quality relative to cost. User reviews on comfort can be a good resource to check before purchasing.",
