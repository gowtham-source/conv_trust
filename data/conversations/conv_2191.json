Here are a few suggestions:\n\n*   **Perturbator**: Known for his dark and heavy synthwave sound.\n*   **Carpenter Brut**: Another great choice, often incorporating elements of metal.\n*   **Dance with the Dead**: Upbeat and energetic synthwave.\n\nWould you like links to those albums or to hear about more artists?",

Here's a couple of suggestions that might fit the bill:\n\n*   **Timecop1983**: While fairly well-known, they have a more atmospheric, lo-fi feel than some of the bigger synthwave acts. \n*   **Droid Bishop**: Blends synthwave with more ambient soundscapes.\n\nI'm still learning, and finding super niche artists is a challenge. I am constantly being updated, though, so I'll keep learning more and more.",
