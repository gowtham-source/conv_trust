Based on those, I would recommend checking out 'The Way of Kings' by Brandon Sanderson (first book in the Stormlight Archive) and 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' by Scott Lynch. They are both considered some of the best books in the genre.",

      "utterance": "That's a tough one! Finding something *exactly* like Piranesi is difficult, as it's such a unique book. However, for a lesser-known fantasy with a similar sense of mystery and exploration of strange worlds, you might enjoy 'Vita Nostra' by Sergey and Marina Dyachenko. It's a Russian fantasy novel. Alternatively, if you liked the mind-bending aspects of 'Piranesi', 'The Library at Mount Char' by Scott Hawkins might appeal to you. As for less well-known books, I am still working on identifying those. I am unsure of the full breadth of less known fantasy books, but I recommend looking at the Goodreads website.",
