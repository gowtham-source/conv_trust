      "utterance": "Finding a shoe with *all* those specific criteria together can indeed be challenging, especially the sub-9 ounce weight with high cushioning. Most max-cushion shoes tend to be heavier. Models that attempt this balance often use advanced lightweight foams, like some premium options from Nike (e.g., Vaporfly, though they are race shoes) or Adidas (certain Boost models). While achieving all three might be difficult within standard categories, looking at shoes designed for 'responsive cushioning' rather than 'maximum cushioning' might get you closer. We can filter by weight and breathability if you like, but the cushioning level is often subjective and correlated with weight.",
