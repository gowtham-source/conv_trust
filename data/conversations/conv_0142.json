It's a 4X fantasy game with diverse factions and a unique world. Or perhaps 'Into the Breach', a turn-based strategy game with a focus on small-scale battles and time travel mechanics?",

However, based on your preference for less rigid gameplay, you might enjoy 'They Are Billions'. It's a real-time strategy game with a focus on base-building and defending against massive hordes of zombies. The sheer scale of the zombie attacks offers a lot of tactical flexibility.",

It's a minimalist micro-strategy game where you build and expand your kingdom on horseback. It features beautiful pixel art and a calming soundtrack. While there are threats, the overall pace is slower and more focused on exploration and management, rather than intense combat. Give it a look and let me know what you think!",
