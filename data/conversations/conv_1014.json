A statement necklace (check clearance sections), a colorful scarf (thrift stores are great for this), or even just rolling up your sleeves in a specific way can elevate the look. Also, experiment with different ways of tucking in your top \u2013 a full tuck, a front tuck, or even tying a knot. You could also try DIY-ing some distressing on your jeans, if you're feeling crafty!",
