However, the Jabra Elite 45h are frequently praised for their performance-to-price ratio, and are quite compact for travel. Though, be warned, the noise cancellation is likely a bit less strong than the ones I originally mentioned. Can you accept an inferior level of noise cancelling, if it means you can get a pair of headphones that are better suited for travel, without going over budget?",
