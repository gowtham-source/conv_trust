      "utterance": "Okay, tiling the shower with subway tile is a popular choice! For subway tile in a shower, you'll generally want to use a modified thin-set mortar. This provides better adhesion and water resistance than unmodified thin-set. Look for a mortar specifically designed for tile sizes similar to subway tile (typically 3x6 inches). Check the tile manufacturer's recommendations as well \u2013 they often specify the best mortar for their product. Brands like Custom Building Products and Mapei are generally reliable.",

While white is a classic choice, it can highlight any imperfections in your tile installation and can be difficult to keep clean in a shower environment. Consider a light grey, which will be more forgiving and still provide a clean look. Ultimately, it's personal preference, but I recommend browsing pictures of showers with different grout colors alongside subway tile to get a better idea of what you like.",

Applying thin-set too thick can compromise its strength and lead to cracking. It's far better to correct the level of the shower pan itself. You might need to apply a self-leveling compound to the pan *before* tiling. Can you tell me what material your shower pan is made of? This will help determine the correct self-leveling compound to use.",

For an acrylic shower pan, you'll need a self-leveling compound specifically designed for use with plastics or flexible surfaces. Read the product label carefully. Ensure the compound is compatible with acrylic and waterproof. Also, proper surface preparation is crucial \u2013 clean and prime the shower pan according to the compound's instructions.
