Your approach using two pointers is correct, often called Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm. \n\nTime complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list (worst case \u2013 no cycle).\nSpace complexity: O(1) (constant space, only using two pointers).\n\nProving it is a bit involved. The core idea is that the fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. If a cycle exists, they will eventually meet within the cycle. Think of it as a race around a track; the faster runner will eventually lap the slower one.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate more on the proof?",
