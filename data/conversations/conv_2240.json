Check for any debris in the hole. 2. Make sure the faucet base is oriented correctly. 3. Try gently wiggling and applying slight downward pressure. If that doesn't work, you might need to slightly enlarge the hole, but be careful with that. I would not recommend doing that at all unless you have experience.",

Before you go that route, can you give me the exact measurements of the hole and the faucet base, also what material the countertop is made of? This will help me determine the best course of action, including the appropriate drill bit if it is necessary. Providing photos might also assist me. Furthermore, it is very important to determine the best bit based on the countertop material.",

Given the size difference, I recommend a 1 1/2 inch hole saw or a step bit that can accommodate that size. Be sure to drill slowly and steadily, and ideally use painter's tape to prevent chipping the laminate. It's always best to err on the side of caution. Good luck, and feel free to ask if you have more questions.",
