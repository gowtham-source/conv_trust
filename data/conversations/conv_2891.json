The Galaxy A54 has a slightly larger battery capacity (5000 mAh vs 4410 mAh for the Pixel 6a). Real-world performance can vary based on usage, but many reviews suggest the A54 *might* edge out the 6a slightly in longevity under heavy loads due to that larger capacity and potentially more efficient processor in some scenarios. However, the Pixel's adaptive battery features are also quite effective.",
