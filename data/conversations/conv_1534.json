Connect the white wire from your new fixture to the white wire in the ceiling box. Connect the ground wire from the new fixture to the green or bare copper ground wire (or screw) in the ceiling box. Use wire connectors (wire nuts) to secure these connections. Make sure to twist the wires together well before screwing on the wire connectors. Double-check the instructions for your new fixture; they might give specific guidance. **Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide definitive electrical advice. If you're uncomfortable or unsure at any point, it is always best to consult with a qualified electrician.",
