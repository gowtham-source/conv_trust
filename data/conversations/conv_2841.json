      "utterance": "That's a great question, and it can be tricky. Minimum Connection Times (MCTs) are set by airlines and airports, not a universal standard. They vary based on the specific airport, whether you're changing terminals, and if you need to go through security again. While airlines publish these times and booking systems usually adhere to them, a delay on the first flight can definitely cause issues. There's no guaranteed way to know if a short connection will be successful if there's a delay, as it depends on many factors like the length of the delay, gate proximity, and efficiency of airport operations. Regarding the cheapest non-stop flights for your dates, the lowest fare I see right now is around $250 round trip with United, departing ORD at 8:30 AM on the 10th and returning from DEN at 4:00 PM on the 14th.",
