Based on your preference for minimalist aesthetics, I recommend checking out these brands:\n\n*   **Adidas:** Specifically, the Ultraboost or Stan Smith lines.\n*   **Common Projects:** Known for their Achilles Low, a staple in minimalist footwear.\n*   **Greats:** Offers various sleek and simple sneaker styles.\n\nWould you like me to provide links or more information about specific models from these brands?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! While all of the brands mentioned prioritize aesthetics, the Adidas Ultraboost models, with their responsive boost cushioning, might offer a bit more stability due to the sole design, and slightly elevated heel. However, stability is really about individual foot shape and gait. I would highly recommend trying any shoe on in person if you can to make sure they fit and provide adequate support for you. I unfortunately can't make an accurate recommendation as to which shoes will prevent you from tripping. \n\nPerhaps you could check out a local running or athletic shoe store; they often have staff trained in foot analysis and can help identify shoes that offer the support and stability you need.",
