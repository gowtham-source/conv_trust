Those O-rings typically go between the faucet body and the water supply lines, and on the supply lines themselves. However, the exact placement can vary. For the large nut, you'll likely need a basin wrench to reach it. Try watching a YouTube tutorial specific to your faucet model. Since I don't have access to your actual installation, that may be the easiest method to get this done. Good luck!",
