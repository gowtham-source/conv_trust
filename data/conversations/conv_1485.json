Considering your needs for wireless and a budget around $100, with a preference for durability, I recommend the 'HyperX Cloud Flight' and the 'SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless'. Both are generally well-regarded and should meet your needs. Would you like me to elaborate on either of those?",

The SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless does not have active noise cancellation either. They do have decent passive noise isolation due to their closed-back design. If you're set on active noise cancellation and wireless in this price range, it will be difficult. I can provide some alternatives that might stretch your budget a bit, or we can prioritize features. How important is noise cancellation, really?",
