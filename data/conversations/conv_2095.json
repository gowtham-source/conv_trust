Then, gather your tools: adjustable wrench, basin wrench, plumber's tape, and possibly a screwdriver. What type of faucet are you installing? Knowing that will help me provide more specific guidance.",

Then, use your adjustable wrench to gently loosen the nuts. Make sure you're turning the correct direction (usually counter-clockwise to loosen). Be careful not to strip the nuts. If that doesn't work, you might need a basin wrench for those hard-to-reach areas. Also, consider taking pictures as you disconnect the old faucet so you have reference for installation.",

      "utterance": "Okay, the mounting plate usually sits under the faucet body and provides stability. The O-rings create a watertight seal to prevent leaks. First, make sure the mounting plate is aligned correctly with the sink holes. The faucet should sit securely on the plate. Then, carefully place the O-rings on the appropriate connections (usually where the water lines connect). Refer to the diagram if you can. Without seeing the instructions, I can't give more precise guidance. Could you take a picture of the diagram or specific instructions and send them to me? Also, what type of sink do you have? This affects the mounting process.",
