I'm particularly concerned about questions related to scaling and distributed systems... I've worked with them, but explaining the concepts concisely is tough.

To address scaling to millions of requests per second, you'd typically start by discussing the core components: load balancers, caching mechanisms (like CDNs or in-memory caches), database sharding or replication, and asynchronous processing (e.g., message queues). You should also consider network latency and bandwidth limitations. We can delve deeper into each of these, or if you prefer, we can start with some practice questions to identify your weak points?",
