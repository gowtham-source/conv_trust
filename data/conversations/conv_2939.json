For comfort and style, you might consider a quality pair of suede or leather loafers (like penny loafers or bit loafers), or perhaps desert boots or chukka boots in suede. Derby shoes in a slightly less formal finish, like burnished leather, can also work well.",

      "utterance": "That's a very common point of confusion, as the lines can be subtle! Generally, a leather Derby is considered slightly more formal than a suede desert boot. For your relaxed business casual look, both can work, but the suede desert boot often complements the texture of chinos or dark jeans a bit more casually. Think of suede as leaning weekend casual, while polished leather leans more office/evening. It's less about a strict rule and more about the overall vibe you want \u2013 suede is relaxed, leather is a touch sharper.",
