Our 'popularity' metric is a combination of factors: recent sales volume, average customer review scores (factoring in the number of reviews), and current trends on social media platforms where our products are discussed. We try to provide a balanced view, but you're right to be cautious. For more in-depth product analysis and personalized recommendations, you might find it beneficial to filter your preferences to narrow down the choices that truly match your specific needs.",
