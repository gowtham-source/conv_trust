Here's a breakdown of common sorting algorithms, their time complexities (best, average, and worst-case scenarios), and factors influencing algorithm selection:\n\n[Table containing sorting algorithms and complexities]\n\nChoosing the right algorithm involves considering these factors:\n*   **Data Size:**\n    *   For small datasets, simple algorithms like Insertion Sort can be fast and efficient due to their low overhead.\n    *   For large datasets, efficient algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort are crucial.\n*   **Data Type:**\n    *   Some algorithms may perform better with specific data types, such as integers versus strings.\n*   **Stability:**\n    *   A stable sorting algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements. This is important in certain applications.\n*   **Memory Usage:**\n    *   Some algorithms have higher space complexity than others.\n*   **Pre-sorted Data:**\n    *   If the data is partially sorted, algorithms like Insertion Sort can be highly efficient.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps provide example scenarios where these differences matter?",
