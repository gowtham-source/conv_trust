'Age of Wonders: Planetfall' also has fantasy elements with sci-fi. Alternatively, you might like 'Crusader Kings III', a grand strategy game with a medieval setting, though it has a steep learning curve.",

However, the core game offers a lot of content and replayability on its own. You can always start with the base game and then decide if you want to delve into the DLC. Some DLCs are considered essential, others are more optional. I suggest looking up a guide on what's 'must-have' to start and maybe wait for sales.",
