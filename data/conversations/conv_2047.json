      "utterance": "That's a complex but common concern. To determine if your 401k contributions are sufficient, we'd need to analyze a few factors: your current balance, your annual income, your estimated retirement expenses, and the assumed rate of return on your investments. I can generate a rough estimate based on some assumptions, or you can consult a financial advisor for a more personalized plan. As for market crashes, that is a significant risk. There are strategies to mitigate this, such as diversifying your portfolio and adjusting your asset allocation as you approach retirement. A financial advisor can help you implement these strategies too.",
