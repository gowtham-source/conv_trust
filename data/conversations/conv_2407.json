      "utterance": "That's a great, and challenging question! Implementing a priority queue with a self-balancing tree like a red-black tree generally offers O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the highest priority element, as well as O(n) space complexity to store the tree. Binary heaps, on the other hand, typically provide O(log n) insertion and deletion, but retrieving the highest priority element (the root) is O(1).  Space complexity is also usually O(n) for a heap. However, the constant factors can matter, and a binary heap often performs better in practice for the *operations themselves* due to its simpler structure. Red-black trees can have higher overhead due to the balancing operations. Does that help?",
