Consider a pair of well-fitting dark wash jeans (you can often find good deals at Target or Old Navy), a neutral-colored t-shirt or two, a simple sweater or cardigan, and a pair of comfortable sneakers or flats. These items can be mixed and matched to create multiple outfits. Check out sale sections and clearance racks for the best prices!",
