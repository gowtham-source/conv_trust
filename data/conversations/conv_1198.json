Brown leather loafers pair well with a variety of pant colors and fabrics. White dress sneakers offer a clean, modern look that can be dressed up or down. Black dress sneakers are also versatile, especially in more formal settings. Once you have those basics covered, you can explore more adventurous colors and materials.",
