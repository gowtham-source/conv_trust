The leather can be stiff at first, but after some wear, they become quite comfortable for walking. They are also quite durable. However, there are a lot of different variations on the Air Force 1. Some may offer more arch support than others.",

The prices can fluctuate, but you can often find Vans for around $60-$80, Stan Smiths for $80-$100, and Air Force 1s for $100+. I'd recommend checking online retailers like Zappos or Amazon to compare current prices.",
