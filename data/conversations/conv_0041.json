'Luigi's Trattoria' has excellent reviews for their pasta dishes, and 'Bella Italia' is known for their wood-fired pizzas. Alternatively, since you're open to suggestions, would you be interested in trying a new Mediterranean place called 'Olive & Vine'? It's gotten some buzz recently.",

      "utterance": "That's a great question. I don't have specific nutritional information for 'Olive & Vine'. However, based on typical recipes for similar dishes, a lamb souvlaki platter is likely to be significantly higher in both calories and fat compared to a grilled chicken salad. The lamb can be quite fatty, and the platter often includes pita bread and tzatziki sauce, adding to the calorie count. A grilled chicken salad, especially if you ask for the dressing on the side, would generally be a healthier option.",
