It's a 4X game inspired by Civilization but focuses on dynastic management and has a more streamlined interface. Another option is 'Age of Empires IV', which provides a solid real-time strategy experience.",

I feel like a lot of these games are just variations on a theme. Sell me on why Old World is uniquely engaging. And thanks for the recommendations so far, by the way!",
