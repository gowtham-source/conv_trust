Let's denote the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall as 'x', and the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground as 'y'.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which is x^2 + y^2 = 10^2. Do you follow that?",

      "utterance": "Great question! If an angle were involved, you'd likely use trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, or tangent to relate the variables. For example, if you had an angle theta between the ladder and the ground, you could use cos(theta) = x/10. Then you'd differentiate that equation. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better about it. Do you want to finish solving the initial problem?",
