      "utterance": "Thank you for providing the details for Jane Doe's claim on 2023-10-26. A 'Duplicate Claim' rejection (often code 18 or 19) specifically indicates that the payer's system found a previously processed or currently pending claim with the same key information (like patient, provider, date of service, and procedure code). While it's usually straightforward, it's possible a clerical error occurred either on your end (like accidentally sending it twice) or the payer's end (processing a different service or date incorrectly that triggered the duplicate flag). It's unlikely related to authorization if the denial code is strictly 'duplicate'. The best course of action is often to contact Payer ID 12345 directly with the claim details to inquire if they have a matching claim on file and its status. If they confirm no prior claim exists, request that they reprocess your submission.",
