      "utterance": "That's a fair question! While Slay the Spire has card game elements, the strategic depth comes from carefully planning your deck, resource management, and making tactical decisions each turn to optimize your build and overcome challenges. As for how I define strategy, it involves games that require planning, resource allocation, and decision-making to achieve specific goals, considering potential consequences and adapting to dynamic situations. My algorithms analyze game mechanics and player reviews to identify these elements. Essentially, it is based on a consensus from many sources and the actual mechanics used in game.",
