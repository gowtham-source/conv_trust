Based on the information you've provided, and given the CPT code 97110 (Therapeutic procedure, one or more areas, each 15 minutes; therapeutic exercises to develop strength and endurance, range of motion and flexibility), the denial likely means UnitedHealthcare doesn't believe this service is medically necessary. I recommend reviewing the plan's medical policies for that specific CPT code. You may also want to check the patient's plan details on the UnitedHealthcare website to see if there is a specific exclusion for this type of therapy.",

It's worth pursuing, especially if the treatment is essential. As for processing times, they vary. Federal guidelines require a decision within 30 days for standard appeals, and sometimes faster for urgent care. Check the specific plan documents for their stated timelines.",
