I consider a few things:\n\n*   **User Reviews:** Player feedback often highlights difficulty.\n*   **Puzzle Complexity:** Number of steps, conditional logic, and interdependencies.\n*   **Time to Solve:** How long, on average, it takes people to beat the game, with more challenging ones taking longer.\n\nI analyze a combination of these factors, which lets me give you a recommendation.
