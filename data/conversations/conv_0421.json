Look for brands that prioritize sustainable practices, such as using vegetable-tanned leather or sourcing from tanneries with responsible waste management. Certifications like the Leather Working Group (LWG) can also indicate more ethical production. Researching a brand's sustainability reports and supply chain transparency is a good starting point.",
