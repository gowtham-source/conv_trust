Regarding the late checkout, guaranteeing a specific time like 3 PM or 4 PM is challenging as it's usually subject to the hotel's availability on the departure day. I can search for hotels known to be more flexible with late checkouts or filter for properties where you can request a later time, but a guaranteed checkout that late is rare without booking an extra night or paying a significant fee. Would you like me to look for hotels that are generally accommodating with late checkout requests, or perhaps focus on options near your meeting location?",
