Under 'Programming Languages,' list Python, R, and SQL, and briefly mention a project where you successfully utilized each. For 'Machine Learning,' list specific algorithms you're familiar with (e.g., Regression, Classification, Clustering) and again, try to tie them to specific projects. Quantifiable results are always a plus! For example, instead of saying \"Used regression,\" say \"Improved prediction accuracy by 15% using linear regression.\"",
