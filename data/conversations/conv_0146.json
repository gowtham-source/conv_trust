Given your shower dimensions (approximately 12 square feet), you'll need to factor that into your tile order, accounting for potential cuts and breakage (add about 10-15% extra). As for the tiling process, it involves preparing the surface, applying mortar, setting the tiles, grouting, and sealing. A detailed tutorial or video may be helpful to fully understand how to tile.",

      "utterance": "Waterproofing is indeed crucial. While porcelain tiles are water-resistant, the grout lines are not entirely waterproof. A waterproofing membrane is highly recommended, regardless of the tile type, especially in a shower. Common types include liquid membranes (like RedGard) and sheet membranes (like Kerdi). Liquid membranes are generally easier to apply, while sheet membranes offer more consistent thickness. The best option depends on your experience level and the specific shower configuration.",
