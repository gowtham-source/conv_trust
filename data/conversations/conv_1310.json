They can perform tests and get a much better understanding of your condition. To help with stress in the meantime, consider relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, and ensure you\u2019re getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep. You can also try to improve your diet - eating balanced meals at regular intervals will likely help.",
