Be clear about your skills and what you're looking for in a team.",

Firstly, carefully select your LLM API, prioritizing those with documented bias mitigation strategies and transparency. Secondly, implement input sanitization and output filtering mechanisms to flag potentially harmful content. Finally, be upfront about the limitations of your model and the potential for biased outputs in your presentation. Judges will appreciate the ethical awareness and proactive measures.",
