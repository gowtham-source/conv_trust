For your budget and style, I recommend checking out stores like ASOS, H&M, and possibly some options from Nordstrom Rack or similar discount retailers. Consider focusing on finding a well-fitting dress (or separates) and then accessorizing smartly. \n\nHere's a challenging question though. With a $200 budget, how should one allocate the funds between dress, shoes, and accessories? Is there a recommended ratio to ensure a cohesive look?",
