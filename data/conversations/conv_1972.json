Proving a retaliatory firing can be difficult, as it requires demonstrating that your reporting of the safety violations was a 'motivating factor' in the decision to terminate your employment. You may want to contact an attorney specializing in employment law for guidance on building a case. I am still under development and cannot offer legal advice.
