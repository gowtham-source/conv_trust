      "utterance": "Thank you for the zip code! Finding something Italian, comforting, and 'different' that can also be delivered within 30 minutes can be a bit tricky as delivery times depend on current restaurant volume and driver availability. I can certainly look for Italian restaurants in 90210 that have unique dishes or perhaps highly-rated options that aren't the typical spaghetti. However, I cannot guarantee a 30-minute delivery window as those estimates can change rapidly. Would you like me to show you some highly-rated Italian options with potentially faster delivery estimates?",
