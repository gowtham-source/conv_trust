Considering your persistent cough and shortness of breath, especially given the duration, it's important to consult a doctor for a proper evaluation. They can conduct necessary tests to determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment. It could also be allergies, asthma, or a lingering viral infection. Early diagnosis is always best for peace of mind.",
