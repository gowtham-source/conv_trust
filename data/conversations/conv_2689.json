I need to tailor my resume and cover letter, but their job description is really specific about requiring experience with 'agile methodologies in a biotech context'. My background is mostly in traditional project management in manufacturing. How do I even bridge that gap?",

Can you tell me about specific projects where you had to adapt quickly, manage cross-functional teams, or work under iterative processes, even if not formally 'agile'? We can frame these experiences using agile language. For the biotech context, highlight any projects where you worked with technical teams or in regulated environments, if applicable.",

      "utterance": "Okay, let's refine this. Instead of trying to force a direct match, focus on the *principles* of agile that you applied. For example, 'managed changing project scopes through iterative planning' is better than saying you did 'sprints'. For the biotech context, while you lack direct experience, you can perhaps mention your ability to quickly learn complex technical concepts and adapt to strict regulatory requirements, referencing your manufacturing experience. You could also add a sentence about your strong interest in the biotech field and eagerness to apply your project management skills in this area.",
