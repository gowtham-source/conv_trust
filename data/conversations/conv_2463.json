Our recommendations are generated based on matching product attributes to the needs you describe, drawing from product data and popular models known for specific qualities. Regarding the keyboard, the Lenovo ThinkPad series is often praised for its excellent typing experience, considered among the best. Dell XPS keyboards are also high quality, but subjective preference plays a role. Both lines are generally built for longevity, especially within their higher-tier configurations. However, specific model year and configuration can impact this. You can find detailed specs and user reviews on individual product pages.",

For exceptional battery life and reliability in a mid-range price point for work/browsing, consider these specific models: the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 (known for solid performance and keyboard) or possibly a previous generation Dell XPS 13 (like a refurb or sale model) if battery life is paramount. The Acer Aspire 5 series can also offer good value and decent battery in the mid-range, though often slightly heavier than ultrabooks.
