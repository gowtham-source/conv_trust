If a package tracking shows no movement for an extended period beyond the expected delivery window, we can initiate an investigation with the carrier. The specific timeline for considering a package 'lost' can vary slightly depending on the carrier and destination, but it's typically after 7-10 business days of no updates past the last expected delivery date. Once confirmed as lost, we can process a refund or arrange a reshipment, subject to item availability. Let's monitor the tracking for another day, and if there's still no update by tomorrow, please contact us again so we can look into starting that investigation process for you.",
