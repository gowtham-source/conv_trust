You should also reference the email and photos you sent previously. As for the costs of litigation, these can vary widely depending on the complexity of the case and the attorney's fees. It's difficult to provide an exact estimate without a full case assessment. Litigation could also take months, if not longer. Have you considered mediation as a first step after the demand letter?",
