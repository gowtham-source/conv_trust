      "utterance": "That's a classic question, and yes, it can feel tricky to navigate authentically. The standard advice is to choose a genuine area for improvement that is relevant to the job but not a critical requirement, and then demonstrate self-awareness and a plan for addressing it. For example, you could mention improving your presentation skills or becoming more efficient with a specific less-used tool, and then explain the steps you are taking to develop in that area. The key is to show self-awareness and a commitment to growth rather than listing a fundamental flaw or a disguised positive. Does discussing a specific example help clarify the approach?",
