I am also cross-referencing with our latest customer reviews to ensure quality for you. Here are a few models generally available under $600:\n\n1.  **Acer Aspire 5:** A solid all-around choice, often available with various configurations. Check the specific specs for your budget.\n2.  **HP 14 Series:** Another good option, often with sales and discounts. Be sure to check the exact model and configuration to ensure it fits within your budget.\n3.  **Lenovo IdeaPad:** These are generally reliable with a good balance of performance and price. Again, confirm the specs.\n\nI'll provide links once you confirm which model interests you. Are there any specific specs that you need in order for me to narrow down the recommendation?",

While I can provide recommendations based on general availability and often-updated customer reviews, I cannot *guarantee* performance, as specific models vary. However, I can guide you towards models with more powerful processors and enough RAM for your needs. For Chrome tabs and light video editing, I'd recommend looking for models with at least an Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 processor and a minimum of 8GB of RAM. I will need to know which model you would like to look at for more information about the processor. Would you like me to find the specifications and compare some of the Acer, HP, and Lenovo models for you? Also, performance is based on the software, as well as RAM and the processor.",
