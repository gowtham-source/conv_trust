At that price point, you might be able to find models with slightly better processors (like an AMD Ryzen 5 or an Intel Core i5 of a newer generation) or more RAM (16GB instead of 8GB, which is becoming increasingly important). As for future-proofing, these are mid-range laptops, so while they'll handle typical tasks for several years, demanding applications or games may require compromises in settings as time goes on. A device at this price point will likely be usable for everyday tasks for 3-5 years. Would you like me to focus on laptops closer to $900?",
