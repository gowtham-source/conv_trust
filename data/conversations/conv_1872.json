Let's work through an example. Imagine a ball thrown horizontally. What happens to its horizontal and vertical motion?",

      "utterance": "Apologies, I will explain in more detail. Lets say, we are going to calculate the range. First, you need to break down the initial velocity into vertical and horizontal components using sine and cosine functions with the launch angle. From the vertical component, we can determine the time of flight. The time of flight is affected by gravity, so take the vertical component, divide it by the gravity (9.8 m/s^2) and multiply it by 2. Then you can calculate the range. For example: If the initial velocity is 20 m/s and the launch angle is 30 degrees, time of flight is 2.04 seconds, and then use the formula (Initial velocity^2 * sin(2 * launch angle)) / gravity. The range would be approximately 35.35 meters. Yes, air resistance does affect it, usually reducing the range. Air resistance is more complex to calculate, and it is beyond my expertise for now.",
