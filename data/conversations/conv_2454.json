Your best bet is usually to try and identify the faucet manufacturer or model number, which might be etched somewhere on the faucet body itself, possibly underneath. If you can find that, you can check the manufacturer's website for parts diagrams. Alternatively, you can take the old cartridge to a plumbing supply store, and they might be able to match it based on its appearance and dimensions.",

A more direct approach online might be to carefully take clear photos of your faucet from different angles and the old cartridge you removed. Many plumbing forums or DIY communities online can help identify the faucet type and potential cartridge based on photos. Some manufacturers also offer online tools where you can upload photos to help identify parts. It requires a bit more effort on your end, but it can be quite effective.",
