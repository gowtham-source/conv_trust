Evidence like your own photos (taken when you moved in and out), witness testimony (if anyone saw the condition of the apartment), and receipts for cleaning supplies could be helpful. As for the landlord's photos, you can argue that they are not representative of the apartment's condition when you vacated. A judge would weigh all the evidence to make a decision. To get a better idea of your chances and the best course of action, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional who can review your specific circumstances and relevant laws.",
