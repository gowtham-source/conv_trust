Our recommendation engine uses a combination of factors, including sales data, customer reviews (both positive and negative), product specifications, and even comparisons to similar products. We also factor in current promotions and inventory levels. Basically, we are trying to find the best 'fit' for your specified category and hopefully your needs. Let me know if you have more questions about it.",
