Given her interest in cooking and your budget, how about these options: A high-quality olive oil and vinegar set ($30-40), a set of nice kitchen towels ($20-30), or a subscription to a meal kit service (a single box could fit within your budget if you choose wisely).

      "utterance": "That's a great question. Finding a one-time box for a meal kit service within that budget can be tricky as many subscriptions charge a weekly fee or a minimum commitment. However, you might be able to find a meal kit box from services like HelloFresh or Blue Apron through sites like Groupon, or sometimes directly through the service with special offers. I would strongly recommend you read the terms and conditions of any service you are considering and also look for any extra fees such as shipping or handling as the total cost may be more than $50.
