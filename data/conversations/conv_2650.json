On the resume itself, if you feel it needs mentioning (sometimes it's best in the cover letter), you could add a brief line under your Experience section timeframe or create a dedicated 'Professional Sabbatical' or 'Personal Project' entry. For phrasing, think about the skills: 'Managed complex care schedule and logistics,' 'Developed strong problem-solving and coordination skills,' or 'Provided dedicated support requiring significant organizational and interpersonal abilities.' Framing it this way highlights transferable skills gained during that period.",
