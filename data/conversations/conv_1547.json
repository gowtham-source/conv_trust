First, the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 3 is a good choice for cushioning and comfort. Then there's the Brooks Glycerin 20, also known for its cushioning. Finally, the Hoka Clifton 9 is a great option as well, known for its lightweight feel.  Would you like me to tell you about the key features of each shoe?",

The Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 3 *may* be available in wide sizes, but it's a bit difficult to verify the current availability. You would need to check on the specific retailer's website to confirm. To be absolutely certain about the fit, I would recommend checking out a local running store where you can get fitted.",
