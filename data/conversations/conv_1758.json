Oxfords have closed lacing (the eyelet flaps are sewn *under* the vamp), while Derbys have open lacing (the eyelet flaps are sewn *on top* of the vamp). Generally, Oxfords are considered more formal. For a navy suit, you could wear either, but if it's a very formal wedding, stick with black Oxfords. Otherwise, brown Derbys or even a pair of dark brown Chelsea boots (if appropriate for the wedding's formality) could work well.",
