The \u00a3250 price for easyJet is likely for their standard 'Standard' fare, which typically includes a small cabin bag (45x36x20cm). A larger cabin bag (56x45x25cm) or checked baggage would indeed be an additional cost. The exact fee depends on the bag size, weight, and route, and can vary. I can look up specific baggage fees if you'd like to explore a particular flight option.",
