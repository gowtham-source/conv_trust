It's a classic, but essential for any sci-fi fan.\n*   **For Cyberpunk:** 'Neuromancer' by William Gibson.\n\nDo any of those sound interesting?",

Based on your tastes, I can suggest these, though they may still be somewhat known:\n\n*   **Epic Fantasy:** 'The First Law' trilogy by Joe Abercrombie - a bit grimdark, but well-regarded.\n*   **Space Opera:** Consider 'Revelation Space' by Alastair Reynolds. It's often listed, but less widely read than 'Dune'.\n*   **Cyberpunk:** 'Snow Crash' by Neal Stephenson - a bit more tongue-in-cheek than Gibson, but still good.\n\nI hope those are more helpful!
