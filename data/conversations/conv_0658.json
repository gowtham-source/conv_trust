For example, a basic t-shirt can be dressed up with a scarf, a statement necklace, or a cardigan. Play with different color combinations within your chosen palette. Also, don't be afraid to add one or two trendy pieces each season to keep your look current without breaking the bank. For shoes, consider buying a basic white sneaker and a neutral-colored boot that can be worn with most outfits.",

Generally, warm undertones look good in earth tones and golds, while cool undertones look great in blues, purples, and silvers. Choose 2-3 core colors that flatter you and build your wardrobe around those. Neutrals like black, white, gray, and navy can be mixed with anything.
