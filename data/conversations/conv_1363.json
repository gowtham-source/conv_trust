Providing the photo of the sign and presenting your case in a calm and organized manner will likely improve your chances. Researching past cases with similar circumstances in your area could also provide insights into the likelihood of a successful challenge. Further, you might check the ticket to see if there is any information on the specific rules regarding enforcement of this violation. I unfortunately don't have access to specific case law, so I can only provide this general advice.",
