The Acer Aspire 5 series is often available within that price range, offering a good balance of performance and affordability.

However, I can filter my recommendations based on reviews mentioning screen brightness and contrast. Could you tell me what you intend to primarily use the laptop for? Knowing if it's for work, school, or entertainment will help me narrow down the options further, leading to more relevant suggestions.
