We can also explore investment options, considering your risk tolerance. Given your income and savings rate, a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA might be a good place to start for retirement. However, I would need more information about your specific expenses to provide truly customized advice. Could you elaborate on your monthly expenses and the interest rate on your emergency fund?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! Inflation is definitely a factor to consider. We'll need to build that into any projections. Generally, the impact of inflation on your investments is mitigated by choosing investments that historically have outpaced inflation. For example, stocks have typically outpaced inflation over the long term. We'll also need to re-evaluate your investment strategy regularly. Regarding your variable expenses, I recommend using budgeting apps like Mint or YNAB (You Need a Budget) to track your spending. Analyzing your spending will help you identify areas to save more. Can you tell me more about your current investment portfolio and your debt situation?",
