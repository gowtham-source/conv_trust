While both are CRPGs, *Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous* is, in my estimation, more complex in its character building and tactical options than *Baldur's Gate 3*. BG3 is known for its high production value and more streamlined approach. Pathfinder offers more customization options and a more in-depth ruleset, based on the tabletop game. You may also find it more challenging. However, it has a lot of content.",
