Common causes include upper respiratory infections like a cold or the flu. Less common causes can include bronchitis, pneumonia, or even allergies. I cannot provide a diagnosis, but based on your symptoms, I recommend monitoring your temperature and looking for any additional symptoms like shortness of breath. If your cough worsens or you develop a fever, please consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

      "utterance": "That's a good question. While it's difficult to definitively differentiate between a cold and bronchitis without a medical examination, there are some subtle differences. Bronchitis often presents with a cough that produces mucus, sometimes discolored. You might also experience wheezing or shortness of breath. A cold is more likely to cause a runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat initially, with a milder cough developing later. However, these aren't hard and fast rules, and symptoms can overlap. If you're still concerned or if your symptoms don't improve after a week, it's best to see a doctor for a proper assessment.",
