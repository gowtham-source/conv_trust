While I can confirm the package is at the regional center, I don't have access to real-time operational details of the carrier's facilities or information about specific package exceptions unless they are formally logged. Delays can sometimes occur due to high volume or unforeseen logistical events. For the most detailed status updates and potential reasons for the delay, I recommend reaching out directly to the shipping carrier with your tracking number, or you can connect with one of our live agents who might be able to initiate a trace.",
