A simple clutch and some heeled sandals or dressy flats would complete the look. Does that sound appealing?",

You might find a high-quality piece for a fraction of the original price. Also, look for brands that prioritize fair labor practices and use sustainable materials; some smaller ethical brands occasionally have sales or outlet sections. It might require a bit more searching, but it's definitely possible to find something that aligns with your values without breaking the bank!",
