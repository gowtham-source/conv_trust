It's a well-regarded epic fantasy series with a complex magic system and compelling characters. You might also enjoy *The First Law* trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, which offers a darker, grittier take on epic fantasy. Let me know if those sound interesting, or if you'd like me to suggest something else.",

      "utterance": "That's a tough one! Finding something exactly like *The Wheel of Time* is difficult. Considering your preferences, you might find *The Realm of the Elderlings* series by Robin Hobb to be an excellent option, though it has a different tone. It offers rich worldbuilding and deep character development, though it focuses more on character-driven plot. Alternatively, *Malazan Book of the Fallen* by Steven Erikson is another massive series, similar to *The Wheel of Time* in scope and complexity, though it is considered more challenging. I hope these suggestions are helpful!",
