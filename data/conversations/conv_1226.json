I can identify the most relevant keywords and skills mentioned in the job description and compare them to your resume. I can then highlight where you've already addressed these requirements and suggest ways to incorporate any missing keywords or rephrase your existing experience to better match the language used in the job posting. I can also provide suggestions for quantifying your accomplishments. I'll provide you with a report highlighting these points, which will give you a head start on tailoring your resume, so you can then go in and refine it using your own understanding.
