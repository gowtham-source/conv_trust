Loafers offer a smart-casual look that works well with chinos and a button-down, and they can be dressed up or down for weekend activities. Chukka boots are another versatile option, providing a slightly more rugged and stylish look that can transition from work to weekend outings. Would you like me to give you some specific brand or style examples within these categories?",
