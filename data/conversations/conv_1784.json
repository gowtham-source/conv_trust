And regarding O(n) vs O(log n): O(n) indicates linear time, meaning the time it takes to complete an operation increases directly with the size of the input (n). For example, searching for an item in an unsorted array. O(log n) indicates logarithmic time, meaning the time it takes to complete an operation increases much slower than the input size. This is often the case in algorithms that divide the problem into smaller parts such as Binary Search. I'll provide more examples once I have your resume. ",
