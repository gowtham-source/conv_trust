Opt for minimalist styles in neutral tones like white, black, navy, or gray. These will pair well with your chinos and button-down shirts. For example, brands like Common Projects or Oliver Cabell offer great options.",

      "utterance": "I understand. In that case, you might consider a pair of suede chukka boots in a bolder color like olive green or burgundy. They offer a slightly more rugged look than loafers, but are still refined enough for smart casual. Alternatively, look for dress sneakers with subtle textured details, like broguing or woven leather panels. That would add visual interest without being too loud.",
