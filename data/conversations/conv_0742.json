While hackathons often emphasize innovation and technical skill, developers *absolutely* have a responsibility to consider the potential impact of their creations. Building something purely for the sake of it, without considering potential misuse or negative consequences, is irresponsible. Prioritizing ethical design and development, even if it means foregoing a prize, is crucial for the long-term well-being of society. It is important to discuss potential harmful impacts of your idea with your team and the mentors before moving forward.",
