Less common, but potentially serious, causes are anemia, thyroid problems, or even underlying infections. To give you the best advice, could you tell me a bit more about your lifestyle and any other symptoms you're experiencing?",

I'd recommend getting your iron levels checked again through a blood test. If they're low, your doctor can advise on iron supplementation. Regarding the stress, have you considered relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing? Also, the quality of your sleep matters, not just the quantity. Are you sleeping soundly? Finally, what if I don't know what to say? Well, I'm still learning and might not be able to provide an accurate answer... How about we try something different?",
