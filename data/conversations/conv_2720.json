Based on your criteria for one person staying October 10-14 in downtown Chicago near the Magnificent Mile under $250/night, I found a few options. The [Hotel Name 1] is available at approximately $260/night, [Hotel Name 2] is around $235/night but is about a 15-minute walk further away, and [Hotel Name 3] is listed at $280/night. Would you like more details on any of these?",

My search parameters prioritize established hotels and might sometimes include results slightly above the requested budget if they are the closest matches by location or other factors.
