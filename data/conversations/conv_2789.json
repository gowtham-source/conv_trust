My apologies if my previous response wasn't specific enough. For this situation, you should appeal the denial. Include a copy of the electronic submission confirmation report that shows the date the claim was sent, and cite the specific section in the payer's provider manual that states the 90-day timely filing limit from the date of service for this plan. You can also include a brief cover letter explaining that the denial appears to be in error based on your documentation. This provides concrete evidence for your appeal.",
