At the $500 price point, many models, including common configurations of the Aspire 5 and IdeaPad 3, do come with SSDs (Solid State Drives), typically ranging from 128GB to 256GB. An SSD significantly improves speed. However, 128GB can fill up quickly if you have large files. Some very budget options might still have HDDs, but I'd recommend prioritizing an SSD if possible.",

While 128GB SSDs are indeed common at this price point, some models might offer 256GB, or you could consider using cloud storage or an external drive for larger files. Sometimes refurbished models or previous-generation laptops on sale can offer better specs within your budget if you're open to that.",

However, it's not impossible. Keep an eye on specific configurations of laptops from brands like Dell (Inspiron line) or HP (Pavilion line) during sales events. These occasionally drop into that $500-$550 range, but it often requires diligent searching and checking retailer promotions.",
