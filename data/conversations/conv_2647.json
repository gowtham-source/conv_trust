      "utterance": "I understand your concern about sound quality and noise. The Anker Soundcore Life Q20 *does* feature Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which is quite effective for its price range at reducing ambient noise like bus engines or train rumbles. The Sony WH-CH510, however, does *not* have ANC, but it's known for a balanced sound profile for its cost. Sound quality is subjective, but both are generally well-regarded for not being 'tinny' compared to very cheap alternatives. The Anker might have a slightly bassier profile.",

      "utterance": "That's a fair question. At the sub-$100 level, ANC performance won't be on par with premium headphones costing several hundred dollars. However, the Anker Soundcore Life Q20's ANC is generally considered effective for low-frequency noises typical of commuting, making a noticeable difference compared to having no ANC at all. It won't block out voices or sudden sounds completely, but it significantly reduces background hums. It's one of the better implementations you'll find in this specific budget.",
