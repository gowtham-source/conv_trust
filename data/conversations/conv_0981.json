Regarding lifespan, both are entry-level laptops, so heavy usage can shorten their lifespan. Generally, with good care (avoiding overheating, proper battery management, and keeping the software updated), you can expect them to last around 3-5 years. More expensive models often have better build quality and components, which contribute to longer lifespans. However, within your budget, these are solid choices.
