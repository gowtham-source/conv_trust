To make your budget stretch for produce, look for sales flyers from local stores, consider buying frozen vegetables and fruits (they are often cheaper and retain nutrients), or visit farmers markets towards the end of the day for potential deals. Focusing on versatile, filling items like potatoes, carrots, and cabbage can also help. Combining inexpensive staples with just a few fresh items can build satisfying meals.",
