Like, magic and dragons and stuff. It feels like everything is either super dark fantasy soulslike or sci-fi these days, which is kinda frustrating when you just want some classic fantasy adventure.",

It has a large world and fantasy elements. Also, Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning offers a vast fantasy world to explore. Fable III is another older option with a fantasy setting.",

Fable III is probably too old for what I'm looking for graphically, honestly. Thanks for trying though, Inquisition seems promising!",
