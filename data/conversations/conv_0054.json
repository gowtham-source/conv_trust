The Acer Aspire 5 typically offers a good balance of performance and price, and many configurations boast impressive battery life. The HP Envy x360 is a 2-in-1, which offers flexibility, and its battery life is generally quite competitive. Regarding which would give *better* battery life in video conferencing, that would depend on your network speed and display settings -- it is difficult to say.",
