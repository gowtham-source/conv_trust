I don't have live, real-time pricing from specific grocery stores. Therefore, the price estimations are just that - estimates. Prices can definitely fluctuate. I recommend checking the weekly flyers of your local grocery stores or using a price comparison app to get the most up-to-date information before you go shopping. I am always learning and working to incorporate more real-time information. Would you like me to generate the detailed shopping list now, considering these estimated costs?",
