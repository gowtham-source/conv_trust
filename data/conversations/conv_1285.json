      "utterance": "That's a very insightful question. The term 'obscure' is indeed subjective. My understanding of it is based on a few factors: box office performance, the film's availability on major streaming platforms, and the amount of critical and public discussion surrounding it. I also consider the film's age, with older films often being considered less mainstream. I then cross-reference this data with other users' viewing habits. It's a complex algorithm, and I'm always learning to better define and understand these nuances to improve my suggestions.",
