      "utterance": "Yes, you can usually remove incorrectly laid tiles, but it requires some care. Use a grout saw to carefully remove the grout around the problem tiles, then use a chisel and hammer to gently pry them up. You'll likely need to scrape off any remaining thin-set mortar from the subfloor. In most cases, removing the tile won't damage the subfloor if done carefully. However, excessive force could cause damage, so proceed slowly and cautiously. If you are working with drywall or plaster walls, you should score a line into the wall with a utility knife along the edge of the tile to ensure you don't tear off paper facing when removing the tile. If you are truly unsure, you may want to call a professional. ",
