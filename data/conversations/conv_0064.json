Based on your location, I see a highly-rated Thai restaurant called 'Siam Spice', a Vietnamese place named 'Pho Ever', and a Mediterranean grill called 'Olive Branch'. 'Siam Spice' is known for its Pad See Ew, 'Pho Ever' has amazing Pho (obviously!), and 'Olive Branch' has delicious Gyro plates. Any of those sound appealing, or should I keep looking?",

I can also filter reviews to show you the most recent comments about their gyros. Would you like me to do that?",
