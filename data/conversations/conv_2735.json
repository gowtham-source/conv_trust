But what if it's a case where the patient had multiple issues, and the primary diagnosis for the *reason for the visit* isn't typically linked to the specific procedure code, even though the notes justify it?  Is there a way to handle that without automatic rejection?  Like, is there a specific modifier or something for complex cases that still need the primary diagnosis billed?",

      "utterance": "That's a good question regarding complex scenarios. While modifier 25 (Significant, Separately Identifiable Evaluation and Management Service) is used when an E/M service is billed on the same day as a procedure, it doesn't directly address a diagnosis-procedure mismatch for a standalone office visit. For a CO-4 rejection, the most common fix is ensuring the *primary* diagnosis billed aligns with the reason for the visit and supports the procedure code used. If multiple issues exist, ensure the documentation clearly links the diagnosis used on the claim to the service billed. Sometimes, payers have specific local coverage determination policies that detail which diagnoses they will accept for certain procedures.",
