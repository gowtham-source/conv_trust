I recommend trying meals like lentil soup, black bean burgers, pasta with marinara and vegetables, and chicken and rice. For ingredients, you'll need lentils, beans, pasta, rice, canned tomatoes, onions, garlic, some frozen vegetables (broccoli or mixed veggies are budget-friendly), and chicken thighs (usually cheaper than breasts). Would you like me to provide a sample shopping list with approximate prices?",

This totals around $16.25, leaving room for adjustments and other essentials. \n\nRegarding your question about pricing, I am trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which includes information about average grocery prices. While I don't have a real-time, constantly updating database, I use sophisticated algorithms to estimate costs based on the latest available information. It's always a good idea to check your local store's prices before shopping, as variations are common.",
