The Solar Glide is generally a bit more durable. You can also check out the Saucony Kinvara, a great lightweight option, often available within your budget. Does that sound good? I can also provide links for you to view their details.",

I am an AI assistant, and I am trained on a massive dataset. My recommendations prioritize various factors like category relevance, price, and general popularity. For the best advice, I always suggest looking into reviews yourself and seeing which shoes work for you. For a road runner with your budget, you'd be best off exploring the Solar Glide or Kinvara as your top two options. I can provide direct links to them if you like.",
