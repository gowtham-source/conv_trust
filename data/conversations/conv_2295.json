However, if you are set on doing it yourself, you *must* treat every wire as if it is live. Carefully identify the wires from the old fixture. Typically there will be a black (hot), white (neutral), and a ground wire (usually green or bare copper). If you can get me some pictures of your wires and the fixture, I can try to provide further assistance, but again, safety is paramount. There are safety precautions that MUST be followed.
