Budget-wise, maybe under $150? I'm open to brands, but I'm not really into sneakers. Something other than that. I'm frustrated because I never know what looks good!",

Have you considered something like Chelsea boots, desert boots, or perhaps a stylish pair of leather or suede loafers? They all fit the casual-but-stylish description and often come in under $150. I can search online for specific examples if you'd like. However, please note, the results may vary depending on your current location and availability. Also, if you like a specific style I can find them for you.",

      "utterance": "That's a great question, and unfortunately, recommending *specific* brands with guaranteed quality and availability within that price range is challenging, as prices fluctuate. However, I can suggest brands known for quality in general. I would recommend looking into brands like Steve Madden, ASOS, or even looking into some slightly used options by Clarks or Cole Haan. Keep in mind, quality varies even within these brands, so always read reviews before purchasing. You should also search the sites of major retailers like Nordstrom or Zappos and filter by Chelsea boots under $150. You will be much happier than if you bought some random shoes off of a website.",
