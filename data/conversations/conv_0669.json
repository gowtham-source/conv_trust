Light textures can often be painted over with a high-quality primer and paint, but heavier textures may require sanding or skimming with joint compound for a smoother finish. Sanding can be messy, but it's often necessary for optimal results. Consult a professional painter for a definitive answer based on your specific wall texture.",
