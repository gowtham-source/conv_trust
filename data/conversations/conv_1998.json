      "utterance": "You're right to question that. The $8 for chicken is an estimate based on thighs or drumsticks, which are typically more affordable than breasts. I'll adjust that to reflect a more realistic expectation, but it will mean reducing the volume of chicken, or reducing other items.\n\nRegarding protein variety, let's add canned tuna ($3). This gives you more protein options. Maybe we can remove some bread. The updated list will look like this:\n\n*   **Chicken Thighs/Drumsticks:** 2 lbs - $8\n*   **Pasta:** 1 box - $2\n*   **Canned Beans (black or kidney):** 2 cans - $3\n*   **Rice:** 1 bag - $5\n*   **Frozen Vegetables (mixed):** 2 bags - $6\n*   **Eggs:** 1 dozen - $4\n*   **Onions, garlic, carrots:** $7\n*   **Apples:** $5\n*   **Oatmeal:** $4\n*   **Milk:** $4\n*   **Canned Tuna:** $3\n\n*   **Bread:** $2\n\nThis list totals around $57 now.",
