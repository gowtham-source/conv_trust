For fantasy, it's a bit trickier, because the genre is so broad. Have you tried any subgenres? Perhaps something with a more grounded or historical setting?

It has a strong, unique protagonist, avoids many fantasy cliches, and has a more introspective and character-driven narrative. Also, perhaps 'Uprooted' by Naomi Novik. It offers a fresh take on familiar themes. Would you like to know more about these?",
