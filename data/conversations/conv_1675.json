As for overcoming that feeling of overwhelm...I can help you break down the job search process into smaller steps. First, we could look into career paths that best suit your skills and interests based on those you've mentioned. Then we can identify relevant job boards, tailor a resume and cover letter, and prepare you for interviews.",
