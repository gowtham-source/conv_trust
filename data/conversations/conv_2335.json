Instead of just saying you 'increased social media engagement,' say something like, 'Increased social media engagement by 30% in six months, resulting in a 15% rise in lead generation.' Another suggestion is to personalize the cover letter. Refer to something specific you learned about the company, like their recent marketing campaign or a value that resonates with you, to demonstrate that you've done your research and are genuinely interested in the role. Are you asking me how to write a cover letter that is legally compliant with all state, federal, and international laws?",
