For instance, is it formal, semi-formal, or casual? Also, what's your typical style, and what colors do you usually gravitate towards?",

      "utterance": "Okay, I understand! A semi-formal, late afternoon outdoor wedding with a desire to stand out. Based on your preference for neutral colors, here are a few ideas, all aiming to stay within your $200 budget:\n\n1.  **Navy Midi Dress:** A classic navy midi dress is versatile and flattering. You can find some great options online for under $100. Pair it with a statement necklace or earrings (under $30) and some neutral heels or dressy flats (under $70).\n2.  **Black Jumpsuit:** A well-fitting black jumpsuit is chic and easy. Look for one with interesting details, like a wide leg or lace overlay. You should be able to find a nice one for under $120. Accessorize with colorful earrings and a clutch ($30-50).\n\nTo take it a step further: How can I guarantee that the outfits I recommend are available in your size? Since price is so important, I need to make sure that these recommendations are accessible.",
