      "utterance": "Okay, no problem. Let's break it down step-by-step. Glycolysis happens in the cytoplasm and it's where glucose is broken down into pyruvate. The Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) happens in the mitochondria and involves a series of reactions that generate ATP, NADH, and FADH2.  Finally, the electron transport chain uses these to produce a lot of ATP. Does that help at all?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! The Krebs cycle's main function isn't to produce ATP directly, although it does make a little bit. Its primary role is to generate the electron carriers (NADH and FADH2). These molecules then feed into the electron transport chain, where the *vast* majority of ATP is actually made. So, it's a critical link in the whole process.  Think of it like this: the Krebs cycle is the factory that builds the ingredients needed to make the main product (ATP) in the next stage. How's that?",
