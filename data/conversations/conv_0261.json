Based on that, I'd suggest looking into white leather sneakers (brands like Common Projects or Veja are popular), or perhaps Chelsea boots with a sleek silhouette. Alternatively, simple leather sandals like Birkenstock Arizona's could also fit the bill during warmer weather. Does any of that sound appealing?",

Checking the sole construction is also helpful: Blake stitched or Goodyear welted construction are indicators of durable construction. Does that help?",
