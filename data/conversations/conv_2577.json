You can use apps, spreadsheets, or even pen and paper. The key is consistency and finding a method that works for you.",

Beyond basic savings or checking accounts, common options people consider include high-yield savings accounts (for accessible savings), Certificates of Deposit (CDs) for fixed terms, bonds (loans to governments or corporations), mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which bundle various investments, and retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs.
