Considering your preferences for fantasy RPGs with strong stories and character customization, I'd recommend the following:\n\n*   **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt:** A fantastic open-world RPG with an amazing story and character development.\n*   **Divinity: Original Sin 2:** A highly acclaimed RPG with deep character customization and tactical combat.\n*   **Elden Ring:** A more recent title, offering a vast open world and challenging gameplay. Character customization is present but not as deep as Divinity.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these?",

      "utterance": "Elden Ring distinguishes itself through its massive open world, FromSoftware's signature challenging combat, and a more implicit narrative. Unlike Witcher 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2, which heavily feature hand-crafted stories and detailed quests, Elden Ring prioritizes exploration and player discovery. The character customization is present, but the focus is less on detailed build crafting and more on equipment selection and stats to overcome its punishing difficulty. It really depends on what you're looking for. If you want the best story go with the Witcher 3, if you want the best build customization go with Divinity Original Sin 2, and if you want the most challenging game go with Elden Ring.

For strategy games, based on your apparent preference for depth and story, I'd recommend: *   **Civilization VI**: A turn-based strategy game where you build an empire and compete against others.  *   **Crusader Kings III**: A grand strategy game focused on dynasty management in medieval Europe.  *   **XCOM 2**: A turn-based tactical game with a focus on squad management and alien combat.
