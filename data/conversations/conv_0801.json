You could try pairing a simple, solid-colored midi skirt (around $15-20) with a dressy tank top or blouse (around $15-20). Add some simple jewelry and shoes you already own, or look for clearance shoes for under $15. Alternatively, consider a jumpsuit. Some outlets like ThredUp may provide even lower prices on pre-owned clothes. Does this sound like a reasonable direction?",
