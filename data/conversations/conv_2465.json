While CO-18 usually means a duplicate submission from your end, it *can* sometimes occur if the payer's system has received a claim with very similar key identifiers recently, even if it wasn't an exact match or from your system. This could happen due to processing errors on their end or if there was a prior related submission under a different ID. In this specific scenario, if you've verified your submission is unique and the patient data is correct, the next step would be to contact the payer directly with the specific claim details to investigate the reason for the CO-18 denial on their end. They can clarify what their system flagged as a duplicate.",
