      "utterance": "Those sound promising, especially the ThinkPad since I've heard good things about their keyboards and build. But here's a tricky one: how much RAM do I *really* need? Every site says 'more is better,' but I'm seeing options from 8GB up to 32GB, and the price difference is huge! For just spreadsheets and browsing with maybe 15-20 tabs open, plus a video call app running, is 8GB enough, or am I going to regret not getting 16GB? I don't want to overspend, but I also don't want it to be slow in a year or two. It's so confusing!",

      "utterance": "That's a very common question, and you're right, the recommendations can be confusing. For your stated use case of spreadsheets, email, browsing with multiple tabs, and video calls, 8GB of RAM is often considered the minimum acceptable. It *can* work, but with 15-20 tabs and a video call simultaneously, you might experience slowdowns, especially if you have other background processes running. 16GB is generally recommended for a smoother experience and better future-proofing, even for moderate multitasking. While 32GB would be overkill for your needs, stepping up to 16GB is usually worth the investment if your budget allows, as it significantly improves performance under load and helps the laptop feel fast for longer. It's difficult to give a definitive 'yes' or 'no' for 8GB without knowing the specific programs and number of tabs, but 16GB provides a much more comfortable margin.",
