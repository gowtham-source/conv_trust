First, ensure you have a solid financial foundation \u2013 an emergency fund, manageable debt, and contributions to retirement accounts. Then, allocate only a small percentage of your portfolio to high-risk investments like crypto, perhaps 5-10%. This limits potential losses while still allowing you to participate. Diversification is key; don't put all your eggs in one basket. Also, only invest what you can afford to lose.",
