If the initial estimate seems out of line, we'll negotiate with the repair shop or even recommend an independent assessment. Your premiums are based on broader risk factors than a single claim, but frequent claims can lead to increases, so avoiding inflated repair costs benefits everyone. We strive to make sure everything is handled fairly. Is there anything else I can help with regarding cost reviews?",
