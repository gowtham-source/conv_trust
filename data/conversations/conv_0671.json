For a brewery date with that 'effortless chic' vibe and a budget of under $100, I recommend exploring options like a nice pair of dark-wash jeans (you might already own some!), a stylish blouse or sweater (check sales at stores like H&M or Target), and some comfortable but fashionable shoes like ankle boots or clean sneakers. Alternatively, a simple but flattering midi dress can also work. Accessorize with a simple necklace or earrings to complete the look.",
