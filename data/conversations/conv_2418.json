However, I can provide you with meal suggestions based on the principles of budget-friendly, vegetarian eating. I will try to recommend ingredients that are generally inexpensive, and I encourage you to check the current prices at your local stores. Based on your preferences and equipment, I recommend focusing on meals like lentil soup, vegetable stir-fries with tofu, and pasta with a simple tomato sauce. These meals can be cost-effective and healthy. For example, a large bag of lentils and some basic vegetables can provide multiple meals. Would you like specific recipes for any of these, or perhaps some suggestions on how to stretch your budget further with meal prepping techniques?",
