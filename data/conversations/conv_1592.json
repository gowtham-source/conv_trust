But I can search for hotels near Times Square that have verified reviews mentioning 'city view' or 'river view' or similar phrases and fall within your budget. Would you like me to proceed with that search? Also, if you want the absolute best view, hotels on the top floors are your best bet, though they may be more expensive. There's the Paramount Hotel which is known for its views of Times Square, though it might be a bit over $500/night during that time period.",
