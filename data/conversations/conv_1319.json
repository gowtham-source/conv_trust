Based on that, here's a sample meal plan: \n\n*   **Monday:** Lentil Soup (very affordable!) \n*   **Tuesday:** Chicken stir-fry with rice (buy frozen veggies)\n*   **Wednesday:** Pasta with marinara and salad\n*   **Thursday:** Leftovers\n*   **Friday:** Homemade pizza (use store-brand ingredients)\n*   **Saturday:** Eggs and toast for breakfast/dinner\n*   **Sunday:** Roast Chicken (can be stretched for leftovers)\n\nI can provide specific recipes and shopping lists if you'd like.
