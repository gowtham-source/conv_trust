For your budget range of $100-$150 for several items, I would suggest looking at fast fashion retailers like H&M, Old Navy, Shein, or Forever 21. They frequently have sales and promotions, and you can often find basics like t-shirts, casual tops, and leggings or simple trousers within that price point.",

      "utterance": "That's a very valid concern. While navigating budget-friendly options, look for natural fiber blends like cotton mixes or modal, which can sometimes indicate better feel and durability than 100% synthetic materials. Pay attention to seams and stitching â€“ look for even, straight lines. Also, consider shopping during major sales events at slightly higher-tier stores like Gap, Target, or department store clearance sections; you might find quality items marked down into your price range. Focus on versatile pieces you can mix and match.",
