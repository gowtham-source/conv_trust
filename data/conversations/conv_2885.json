While navigating budget-friendly options, look for natural fiber blends like cotton mixes or modal, which can sometimes indicate better feel and durability than 100% synthetic materials. Pay attention to seams and stitching \u2013 look for even, straight lines. Also, consider shopping during major sales events at slightly higher-tier stores like Gap, Target, or department store clearance sections; you might find quality items marked down into your price range.
