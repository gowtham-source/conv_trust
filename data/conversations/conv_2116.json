Based on the information I have, and the lack of supplemental information such as the patient's co-existing conditions I am unable to provide any definitive suggestions on the specific modifier to use. However, I can state that some common modifiers used with 99214 might include -25 (Significant, Separately Identifiable Evaluation and Management Service by the Same Physician on the Same Day of the Procedure or Other Service) or -57 (Decision for Surgery). I suggest checking your documentation to see if these modifiers appropriately apply and then referencing the BCBS policy for specific modifier requirements. I am working on improving my ability to provide more specific billing code suggestions.  Do you have any other questions?",
