We can discuss investment strategies that align with your risk tolerance and understanding. Remember, you're in control. We can explore low-cost index funds or target-date retirement funds which are often recommended as starting points for beginners. It's about finding a balance that you're comfortable with and that works for your specific needs. We can also discuss what factors to look for if you choose to hire a dedicated financial advisor.",
