      "utterance": "That's a great question. The higher price of the Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar is due to several factors. It utilizes higher-quality materials, has advanced training metrics (like recovery time and training effect), more precise GPS, solar charging capabilities, and a wider range of activity profiles. It also tends to have more sophisticated heart rate monitoring and more extensive smart watch features, like music storage. The added value comes from the overall user experience for serious runners and its longer lifespan.",
