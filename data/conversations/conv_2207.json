If the difference is small, you might be able to use a 'faucet adapter plate' which can often compensate for minor variations. If the holes are significantly different, or if you need to create new holes, I recommend consulting a professional. Drilling into countertops can be complex and requires the right tools to avoid damage. I can help you find local contractors if you'd like.",
