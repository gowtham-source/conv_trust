Based on the job description, you should definitely emphasize keywords like 'digital marketing,' 'content creation,' and 'social media management.' Regarding SEO tools, it's best to be specific. Listing 'Moz' is accurate. While SEMrush is mentioned, stating 'Experience with SEO tools including Moz' is truthful and shows relevant capability. You could potentially add a phrase like 'Quick learner with new platforms' if you want to imply adaptability, but stick to what you know.",

      "utterance": "That's a common challenge when applying for roles that stretch your experience slightly. Instead of listing 'multiple platforms,' you can detail the specific platforms you *do* have experience with, like 'Managed Facebook Ads campaigns with budgets up to X.' Then, in your cover letter or during the interview, you can express enthusiasm for expanding your skills to include platforms like Google Ads, perhaps mentioning related analytical skills that transfer. Frame your existing experience as a strong foundation for growth in other areas.",
