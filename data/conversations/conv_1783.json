      "utterance": "Regarding the legal definition of \"vague\", it generally refers to terms that are not clear or precise, leaving room for multiple interpretations. As for the enforceability of a penalty based on vague criteria, it can be challenging. Courts often scrutinize such clauses and may deem them unenforceable if they are not sufficiently clear and unambiguous. However, I recommend consulting with a legal professional for a case-specific assessment, as enforcement depends heavily on jurisdiction and specifics within the contract. I can provide links to legal dictionaries if you'd like to see a legal definition of terms like 'unambiguous'.",

      "speaker": "agent",
      "utterance": "That's a very good question. The governing law clause in a contract specifies which state's laws will be used to interpret the contract. Whether you can sue in your state depends on several factors, including the specifics of the contract, the location of the breach, and the laws of both states. Generally, you may be able to file a lawsuit in your state if the court has jurisdiction over the other party. I strongly advise you to seek advice from an attorney who specializes in contract law. They can provide informed advice and guidance tailored to your location and the specifics of your situation.",
