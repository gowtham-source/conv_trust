While there isn't one single perfect genre name for that specific blend, you might find success exploring bands categorized as 'dream pop,' 'shoegaze' (which can be heavier but has atmospheric elements), or even 'indie folk' with darker tones. For more current artists with a melancholic, atmospheric alt-rock feel, consider checking out The National or Daughter.",
