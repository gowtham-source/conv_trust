How about this: A lightweight, breathable linen shirt (around $30-40 from stores like H&M or Uniqlo), a pair of versatile shorts (denim or khaki, $25-35), a simple swimsuit ($20-30), and a basic pair of sandals or flip-flops ($15-25). That should leave you with a little room for a cheap beach hat. Does that work for you? I can provide specific links if needed, but they will be from generic fast fashion retailers.",
