Based on a $75 budget, I can suggest the following meal plan for the week:\n\n*   **Monday:** Lentil Soup (very budget-friendly!) - approx. $10\n*   **Tuesday:** Chicken Stir-fry with Rice (consider using chicken thighs, which are cheaper) - approx. $18\n*   **Wednesday:** Pasta with Tomato Sauce and Vegetables (use canned tomatoes and whatever veggies are on sale) - approx. $12\n*   **Thursday:** Leftovers\n*   **Friday:** Homemade Pizza (using store-bought dough to save time) - approx. $15\n*   **Saturday:** Chicken Tacos - approx. $15\n*   **Sunday:** Leftovers\n\nThat leaves some room for snacks and pantry staples.
