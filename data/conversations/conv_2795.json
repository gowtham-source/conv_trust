      "utterance": "That's a very insightful question. Defining genres precisely can be tricky, as many films blend elements. Generally, science fiction relies on speculative, futuristic technology, scientific principles (even if fictional), or the impact of science on society. Fantasy usually involves magic, mythical elements, or the supernatural. While films like EEAO use sci-fi concepts (multiverse theory), their narrative focus or use of fantastical elements can blur the line. For something more grounded in traditional sci-fi from the last couple years, perhaps 'Finch' (2021) or 'Voyagers' (2021) might be closer, though they fall just outside your 'last year or two' criteria.",
