While your premium *may* increase in some scenarios, it depends on several factors, like state laws, the specifics of the accident, and your driving history. We will investigate the accident details and determine fault. Your premium is usually not affected if the other driver is found 100% at fault, but it's not always a guaranteed outcome. I can provide you with more specific information related to your policy as we investigate the claim. Currently, the claim is being assessed, and you should hear back from us within 7-10 business days regarding liability.",
