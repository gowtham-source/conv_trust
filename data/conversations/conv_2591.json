When discussing failure, it's important to structure your response using a framework like STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) or PAR (Problem, Action, Result). Focus on the key learnings and how you applied those lessons moving forward. Highlight resilience and growth from the experience. This demonstrates your ability to learn from mistakes, which is indeed valuable for innovation and improvement.",

Like, my failure wasn't because I took a big swing, it was more like a process breakdown. How do I frame *that* as something positive in their context? It feels forced.",

      "speaker": "agent",
      "utterance": "I understand your concern about the framing. For a process breakdown failure, you can frame it by discussing how identifying and addressing that breakdown was a necessary learning step for future, potentially more innovative, processes. Highlight how the failure taught you to build more resilient systems or identify potential pitfalls proactively. You can frame it as a 'learning investment' that enables future 'calculated risks' to be taken more effectively because you've improved the underlying operational stability.",
