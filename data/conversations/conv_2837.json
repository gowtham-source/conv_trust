I'm finding some flights around \u00a3150-\u00a3200 return per person, mostly flying into CDG. For hotels, I see a few options like a place near Gare du Nord or one closer to the Latin Quarter, both around \u00a3120-\u00a3150 per night. The Gare du Nord one is \u00a3125, the Latin Quarter one is \u00a3145.",

Plus, how do I even get from CDG to the Latin Quarter easily? It seems complicated with luggage. Are there any hotels closer to, say, the Marais or Saint-Germain that are still mid-range?

It's relatively inexpensive but can be busy. For hotels in the Marais or Saint-Germain in the mid-range, those areas tend to be pricier. Let me re-search for options specifically in those areas or perhaps slightly further out but with excellent transit links. It might be hard to find many under \u00a3150 in Saint-Germain.",
