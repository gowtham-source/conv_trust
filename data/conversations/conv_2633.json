It requires patience and attention to detail, but it's certainly achievable for a beginner with proper research and planning.

You'll likely need tools such as a hammer and chisel, or potentially a power demo hammer for stubborn areas. Breaking the tiles into smaller pieces often makes them easier to lift. Remember to wear heavy-duty gloves, eye protection, and a dust mask. Thoroughly cleaning the subfloor afterwards is crucial.",

It's not coming up easily with scraping and it's leaving the surface uneven. My question is, do I absolutely *have* to get every single last bit of that old thinset off before putting down the new thinset for the new tile, or can I just apply a leveling compound or a thicker layer of new thinset over the residue? I'm trying to figure out if I need to rent a grinder or something.",

      "utterance": "That's a common scenario when removing old tile. For optimal adhesion and a stable base for your new tile, it is generally recommended to remove as much of the old thinset residue as possible. While a self-leveling compound can address unevenness, applying new thinset over significant old residue can sometimes compromise the bond or affect the curing process. Grinding is often the most effective method for removing stubborn thinset layers from concrete.",
