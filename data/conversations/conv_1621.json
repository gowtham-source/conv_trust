For a casual look, you could pair a basic tee from H&M ($10) with jeans from Old Navy ($30) and sneakers you already own. For something slightly dressier, try a simple dress from ASOS ($35) and some accessories. Can you clarify what you mean by 'accessories' though? Because that's pretty vague...",
