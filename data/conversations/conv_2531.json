      "utterance": "That's a complex scenario involving split occupancy within a single stay. Unfortunately, most standard package bookings and hotel reservation systems are not designed to handle varying numbers of guests within the same reservation period. You would typically need to make two separate bookings: one for 1 person for the initial nights and the final night(s), and a separate booking (or modification) for the nights your friend is present, potentially requiring a room change or a direct arrangement with the hotel after booking the base package for one person. It adds a layer of complexity and might not be possible within a single package deal.",
