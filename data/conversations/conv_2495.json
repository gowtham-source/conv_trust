For claim XYZ1234, the denial reason displayed is indeed 'Coverage Terminated' based on the electronic response from the payer. Common reasons for this conflict can include changes in coverage status between verification and the date of service, or discrepancies in patient data submitted on the claim versus what the payer has on file. Ensuring all demographic and policy information matches *exactly* the eligibility response is vital. While there isn't a single 'loophole', inconsistencies are frequently the cause.",
