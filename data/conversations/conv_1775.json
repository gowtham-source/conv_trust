Given your symptoms, including the blurry vision, headache, and fatigue, along with work-related stress, it's possible you're experiencing eyestrain, dehydration, or tension headaches. The blurry vision could be something else. I suggest that you try increasing your water intake, taking breaks to rest your eyes, and practicing relaxation techniques to manage stress. It's a good idea to get your eyes checked by a professional. Do you have any underlying health conditions?",
