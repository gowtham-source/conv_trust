Okay, focusing on those dates, I see a Virgin Atlantic non-stop from LHR to JFK departing June 11th and returning June 18th for around \u00a3845. Regarding price fluctuations, they are complex, influenced by demand, season, fuel costs, and airline strategies. As an AI, I can analyze historical data and current trends, but I cannot predict with certainty the absolute best day to book or guarantee prices won't change. They can change rapidly.",
