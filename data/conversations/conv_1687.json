Consider brands like Everlane or Uniqlo for quality and minimalist design.\n*   **Bottom:** Tailored chinos or dress pants (around $80-100). Look for brands known for their quality and fit.\n*   **Shoes:** Leather loafers or minimalist sneakers (around $150-200). Brands like Cole Haan or Common Projects offer great options.\n*   **Accessories:** A simple belt and a watch (around $50-80). \n\nThis leaves some room for flexibility.
