I use a combination of your input, skill assessments, interest inventories, and career database information. I also leverage the vast amount of information I have access to, including job descriptions and industry trends, to identify potential career paths. However, the best results will come from honest self-reflection and considering the suggestions with critical thinking. The recommendations I generate are based on your preferences, skills, and interests and may not be perfect, so always approach the process as a starting point.",
