They might also check your iron levels, thyroid hormone levels, and possibly vitamin D levels. You may also need to have a physical examination and perhaps a urine analysis. I can't give you medical advice; I recommend consulting a healthcare provider to obtain testing that may be right for you. It's important to get a proper diagnosis.
