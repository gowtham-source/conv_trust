For less concrete accomplishments, focus on the impact you had. Instead of just saying 'Improved code quality,' try 'Implemented code reviews, leading to a measurable reduction in bugs and improved team efficiency.' If you really struggle with this, and want more specific feedback, I can help you rewrite some of your descriptions given further context.",
