When answering, focus on a situation where something didn't go as planned (the Situation), what your responsibility was (Task), the specific steps you took (Action - which should highlight what went wrong or what you learned *during* the process), and crucially, the positive outcome *from the learning* (Result - how you applied that lesson to future situations or improved).
