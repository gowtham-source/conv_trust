Could you provide details on your most recent project and your role?",

It's often better to provide a list of specific skills relevant to Project Management (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Budget Management, Risk Management) rather than a comprehensive software list unless the job posting highlights a specific software is key. Addressing employment gaps, you can briefly mention the time off with a simple statement like, 'Career Break - Travel and Personal Development'. This shows you're proactive while not dwelling on the gap. I can help you draft those specific sentences as well, if you want.",
