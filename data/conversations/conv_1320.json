Something like the 'Brooks Glycerin' or the 'New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v13' could be suitable options. However, providing a single, perfect shoe recommendation is complex and depends on various factors beyond the information provided. If you'd like a more personalized recommendation, I'd suggest a running shoe store visit for a gait analysis. They can identify your pronation and provide tailored advice. I hope this helps!",
