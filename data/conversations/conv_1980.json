Generally, if the damage was a result of an 'act of God,' liability may be less clear-cut. However, it is likely that the initial responsible party bears responsibility for repairs. I would recommend investigating local ordinances and checking your home insurance policy, to see what coverage is provided for fence damage from storms.",

You can often search for relevant ordinances by keyword (e.g., \"fence regulations\" or \"property line disputes\"). Alternatively, you may contact the city hall directly to get information on the issue at hand. I hope this helps, and I recommend you consult with a lawyer to see if your case is viable.
