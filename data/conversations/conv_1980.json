Generally, if the damage was a result of an 'act of God,' liability may be less clear-cut. However, it is likely that the initial responsible party bears responsibility for repairs. I would recommend investigating local ordinances and checking your home insurance policy, to see what coverage is provided for fence damage from storms.",
