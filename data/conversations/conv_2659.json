Also, how does the system actually *know* what's 'reliable' or 'good value'? Are these just the most popular ones, or is there something more specific it looks at?

My recommendations are based on a combination of factors including sales data, overall performance benchmarks for typical tasks, user ratings, and current pricing relative to specifications.
