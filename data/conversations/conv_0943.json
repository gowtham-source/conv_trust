Some key legal considerations for your online craft business include business structure (sole proprietorship, LLC, etc.), intellectual property (copyrighting your designs), sales tax regulations for your state and any states you plan to sell to, and website terms and conditions/privacy policies. Which of these are you most concerned about at the moment?",

Generally, you're required to collect sales tax from buyers in states where you have a 'nexus,' which usually means a physical presence like an office, warehouse, or employee. However, many states now have 'economic nexus' laws based on a certain sales volume or number of transactions. I can provide you with general information regarding the economic nexus thresholds for each state. However, I am not authorized to give tax advice, I would recommend a tax professional for your specific situation.",
