If the damage existed prior to your tenancy, and you have proof, he cannot charge you for it. Furthermore, claiming the *entire* deposit for what you describe seems excessive. Laws vary by location, but generally, landlords must act in good faith. Let me check the laws regarding security deposits in your state. Could you please provide your state of residence?",

Given your evidence, suing might be an option, but before that, I would strongly suggest sending a certified letter demanding the return of your deposit within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 14 days), citing the relevant California law (Civil Code Section 1950.5) and including copies of your photographic evidence. This demonstrates you are serious and have a valid claim. Document everything.",

Perhaps emails to the landlord mentioning the pre-existing damage upon move-in, or witness statements from anyone who saw the condition of the property before you moved in? If not, you could argue the photos show consistency with 'normal wear and tear,' something landlords can't charge for. A judge would weigh all the evidence. While it's your word against his, a pattern of behavior (withholding deposits unreasonably) could also be considered. Consulting with a local attorney to discuss these nuances specific to your case is always advisable.",
