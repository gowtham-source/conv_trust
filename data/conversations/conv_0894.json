However, given your symptoms \u2013 persistent cough, fatigue, and previous body aches \u2013 it's more likely to be a respiratory infection. Since I cannot provide medical diagnoses, I would strongly recommend consulting a doctor to rule out more serious conditions such as bronchitis or pneumonia. They can properly assess your situation and recommend the best course of action. In the meantime, rest, stay hydrated, and consider using a humidifier.",
