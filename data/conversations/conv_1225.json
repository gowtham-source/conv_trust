In the event of a damaged item, we usually honor the return based on the *shipped* date, which we have recorded in our system, even if the tracking information is delayed or inaccurate.

We can also provide you with an estimated delivery date based on the shipping label if the tracking is not working. We will accept your return within 30 days of our estimated delivery date.",
