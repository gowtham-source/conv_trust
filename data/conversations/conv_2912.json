To prepare, I'd recommend familiarizing yourself with the tools and technologies common in hackathons, especially those relevant to the event's theme. Also, practicing collaboration skills can be very beneficial, as you'll likely work in a team. Expect intense, focused work over a short period and a strong sense of community.",

Here's a slightly different question that's been bugging me: If you build something genuinely innovative during a hackathon that could potentially be a real product, who owns the intellectual property? Is it the team, the organizers, or does it automatically become open source? I'm confused and a bit worried about putting in a ton of work only for someone else to claim it.",

Generally, it's common for the participating teams to retain ownership of the IP they create. However, some hackathons, particularly those sponsored by companies or with specific goals, might have clauses stating otherwise, sometimes related to licensing or usage rights. It is absolutely crucial to carefully read the official rules and terms of the specific hackathon you are attending to understand their IP policy before you begin coding.",
