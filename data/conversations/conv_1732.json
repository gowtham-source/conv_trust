When explaining technical concepts, try breaking them down into smaller parts and use analogies. For example, explain how a linked list is similar to a train. Additionally, practice explaining these concepts out loud. I can provide some sample technical questions if you'd like. Here's a basic one: \"Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.\"",

I'm also a quick learner and would be eager to get up to speed. Could you tell me more about how your team utilizes [Platform Name]?\" This shows your adaptability and willingness to learn.
