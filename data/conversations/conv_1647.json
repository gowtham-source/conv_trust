      "utterance": "That's a great question. The 50/30/20 rule can be adjusted based on your individual circumstances. Needs typically include essential expenses like housing, utilities, groceries, and transportation. Wants are things that improve your quality of life but are not essential, such as entertainment, dining out, and subscriptions. Regarding savings and debt, start by identifying the debt with the highest interest rate and focus on paying that down first. Even small amounts saved and invested can grow over time. I can help you estimate a repayment plan if you provide the specific loan details. For example, the interest rate of each loan, your outstanding balance and the minimum payment due each month.",
