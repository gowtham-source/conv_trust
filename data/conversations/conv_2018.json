Unscrew the old faucet's water lines, and then the mounting hardware. Once that is done, carefully remove the old faucet and install the new one in reverse order.",

The different sized water lines are usually to prevent cross-contamination of hot and cold water, and it's perfectly normal. According to the ShineBright website, the mounting ring is installed by placing the faucet through the counter hole and then using the ring with the included screws. The O-rings are used to seal the connection points. I recommend watching a YouTube video of a similar faucet installation for visual guidance. I will search for videos for you now.",
