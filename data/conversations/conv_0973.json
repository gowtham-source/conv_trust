To determine if their leather is ethically sourced, I recommend checking their website for sustainability reports, looking for certifications like the Leather Working Group (LWG) audit, or contacting their customer service directly to inquire about their sourcing practices. They should be able to provide more specific details about their commitment to ethical and environmental responsibility. You could also search for independent reviews or ethical ratings of the brand online.",
