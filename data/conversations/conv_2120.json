Most faucets use standard sizes (3/8-inch compression or 1/2-inch IPS). You'll need to measure the distance from the shutoff valves to the faucet connections and then purchase supply lines that are slightly longer to allow for some play. It's also important to turn off the water supply *before* you start, and have a bucket and towel ready for any spills! Do you know where your shutoff valves are? And, have you considered checking the faucet's original packaging? Sometimes the supply lines are pre-installed or included.",
