Based on reviews and menus, I can recommend 'Pasta Paradise', but I don't have confirmation if they can do no garlic, you might need to call and ask. There's also 'Tony's Trattoria', which doesn't list garlic in their ingredients, but the reviews are a bit mixed. Do you want me to look for something else, or contact these restaurants for you?",
