      "utterance": "That's a great question. Generally, it is recommended to build an emergency fund equal to 3-6 months of living expenses. While paying down debt, it's still crucial to save a small 'starter' emergency fund. Aim for $1,000 to $2,000, then focus on debt. This way, you have a safety net without sacrificing debt repayment. We can integrate this into the budget and look at strategies for making extra payments on your student loan, such as the debt snowball method.
