Then, we can establish your retirement goals, such as desired lifestyle and retirement age. Finally, we create a plan to bridge the gap. Are you ready to start with your current financial snapshot?",

What types of debts do you have (e.g., student loans, credit cards, mortgage), and what are the interest rates on each? Knowing this helps us prioritize which debts to tackle first. Regarding savings, we can use a retirement calculator to get a rough estimate of how much you'll need, considering your income, expenses, and desired retirement age. Then, we can adjust this based on your debt payments. I can provide some links to useful retirement calculators if you'd like.",
