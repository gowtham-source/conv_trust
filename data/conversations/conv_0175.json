It often goes on sale for around that price, and it offers a good balance of performance and battery life. Alternatively, you could look at a refurbished Dell XPS 13; these are reliable and powerful, and you may find a model within your budget on sites like eBay or Amazon Renewed.",

Regarding new laptops better for gaming near your budget: the Acer Nitro 5 or the HP Victus 15 are frequently recommended. These often have dedicated graphics cards (like an RTX 3050) at the cost of shorter battery life and potentially bulkier design compared to the IdeaPad.",
