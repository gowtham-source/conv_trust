These can range from lifestyle choices like poor sleep or diet, to underlying medical conditions such as anemia, thyroid issues, or even depression.

I am programmed to provide health information, but I am not a healthcare professional and cannot provide a diagnosis. I strongly recommend consulting with your doctor, as a headache and feeling down can be symptoms of multiple conditions. They will be able to assess your symptoms, run tests if necessary, and provide a clear diagnosis.",

Combining these with foods high in Vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, can improve iron absorption. It's important to note that self-treating any medical condition can be dangerous. Always consult with a medical professional before making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, and get an official diagnosis. I hope this information is helpful.",
