You could look for data on traffic flow, accidents, public transportation schedules, etc. A quick search on Google for '[Your City/Region] Open Data' or '[Your City/Region] Traffic API' should turn up some leads. Alternatively, you may need to explore real-time traffic data APIs from providers like TomTom or HERE Technologies, but they sometimes require paid subscriptions.
