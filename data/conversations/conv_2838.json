To start, are there any dietary restrictions or specific types of meals you'd like to focus on (e.g., easy weeknight dinners, breakfast staples)? Knowing that will help me tailor the recommendations.",

Focusing on staples like rice, pasta, beans, lentils, oats, and in-season or frozen vegetables and fruits can be very cost-effective. For protein, eggs, canned tuna, and sometimes discounted chicken thighs are budget-friendly options. Would you like me to suggest a sample shopping list focusing on these types of items?",
