Think about how AI/ML could provide a solution. Don't aim for perfection or groundbreaking innovation in 24-48 hours. Focus on building a functional prototype that demonstrates your idea. Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritize the core functionality. To ensure feasibility, create a basic project plan with time estimates before you start coding.",
