Good options often include loafers, chukka boots, desert boots, or even stylish, clean leather sneakers. It really depends on the specific outfit and occasion.",

Regarding sustainability, it is complex. Some brands use recycled materials or have ethical sourcing practices. Leather can be durable, but its production has environmental impacts. Vegan options exist, but their sustainability depends on the specific synthetic materials used. It's difficult to give a definitive 'best' without looking at specific brand transparency reports.",
