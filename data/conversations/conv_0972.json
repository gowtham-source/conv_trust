This medication helps restore your thyroid hormone levels to normal. While it is often a long-term treatment, it's generally considered safe and effective. Side effects are rare when the dosage is properly adjusted by your doctor. Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to more serious complications, so adhering to your doctor's recommendations is important.",
