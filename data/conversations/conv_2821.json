Landlord-tenant laws generally require landlords to maintain rental properties in a habitable condition, which typically includes providing adequate heating during cold seasons. Your specific rights and the definition of 'adequate' heating can vary significantly based on your lease agreement and the laws in your state or city. I can provide general information, but please remember that I am an AI and cannot provide legal advice. For personalized guidance, consulting with a local attorney or tenant's rights organization is advisable.",

      "utterance": "Taking action like hiring a repair person and deducting the cost from rent, often referred to as 'repair and deduct,' is an option in some jurisdictions when a landlord fails to make necessary repairs that affect habitability. However, this remedy usually comes with very strict legal requirements that must be followed precisely, such as providing written notice, allowing a specific amount of time for the landlord to respond, and ensuring the repair is necessary and reasonable in cost. Failing to follow these steps can jeopardize your standing and potentially lead to legal issues, including eviction. It's really crucial to know the exact rules in your specific location before attempting this.",

While some areas have provisions for rent withholding in specific circumstances, they typically require formal notification and often depositing the rent with the court or an escrow account rather than simply not paying. Because of the complexity and potential legal risks involved in both 'repair and deduct' and rent withholding, your best course of action is to contact a local tenant's rights group or an attorney. They can review your specific situation, explain the exact laws and procedures in your area, and help you determine the safest and most effective way to address the issue.",
