While cutting-edge tech like AI can be impressive, a well-executed, user-friendly application addressing a real problem using simpler technologies can absolutely win. Judges look for novelty, feasibility, impact, and completeness. Focusing on a clear problem and building a functional, polished prototype is often more effective than attempting overly ambitious ideas that don't get finished. Consider projects with strong user interfaces, clear value propositions, or insightful data utilization, regardless of the underlying complexity.",

It allows you to distribute tasks, leverage diverse skill sets (design, frontend, backend, pitching), maintain morale, and work more efficiently under pressure. Most hackathons have dedicated channels or events (like team-building mixers) before the coding starts. Look for individuals with complementary skills, enthusiasm for the theme, and a willingness to collaborate. Don't be afraid to talk to people and share your initial ideas to see if there's a good fit.",
