Let me see...Based on your preferences for fantasy with a similar feel to *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*, but with a more modern setting and faster pace, you might enjoy *Rivers of London* by Ben Aaronovitch. It blends urban fantasy, police procedural, and a touch of humor. Alternatively, *The Rook* by Daniel O'Malley is also an option. It has a more contemporary setting and a fast-paced mystery element. Hopefully one of those works for you!",
