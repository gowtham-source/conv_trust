When you request statements, either online or via phone, we verify your identity using several factors, including your account number, social security number, and date of birth. For online requests, the statements are delivered securely to your online banking portal, which requires multi-factor authentication. If you request paper statements via mail, they are sent to the address we have on file for your account. You can also opt to pick them up at a branch and will need to show identification. We employ encryption and other security protocols to protect your data during transmission and storage. ",
