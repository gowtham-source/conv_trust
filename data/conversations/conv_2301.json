      "utterance": "That's a great question! The best way to determine which shoe is right for you is to consider your foot type (neutral, pronated, or supinated), the distance you typically run, and your personal preferences. The Pegasus 39 is a good all-around shoe for road running. The Brooks Ghost 14 is a more cushioned option, good for longer distances, while the Hoka Clifton 8 is also cushioned, but has a unique rocker design. Unfortunately I can't give specific recommendations without a proper gait analysis or more information.  For trail use, you might consider a trail-specific shoe.",
