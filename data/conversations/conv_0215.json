The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great 2-in-1 option that offers portability and decent performance for everyday tasks. Alternatively, the Acer Aspire 3 often has configurations within that price range that offer a bit more processing power. Would you like me to provide more details on either of those, or are you looking for something specific like screen size or battery life?",
