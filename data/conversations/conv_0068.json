Regarding hotels, I'm finding several options near downtown Denver with free Wi-Fi and a gym that are under $250 per night. The Maven Hotel at Dairy Block and the Kimpton Hotel Born Denver are good options based on user reviews and proximity to attractions. As for your hypothetical zombie apocalypse question, I am not equipped to provide safety recommendations for such a scenario; my primary function is to assist with travel arrangements. Perhaps consider the Brown Palace Hotel, known for its strong structure and historical significance... though that is just a guess. I'll send you the flight and hotel options now.",
