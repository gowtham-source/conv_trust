It's the first book in a trilogy and is set in a post-apocalyptic world with unique magic systems. I also think you might like 'Piranesi' by Susanna Clarke, which is more introspective but incredibly imaginative.",

      "utterance": "Excellent question! 'Piranesi' fits because it departs dramatically from traditional fantasy settings. While not explicitly fantasy in the same way as high fantasy, it evokes a sense of wonder and mystery. The mixed reviews stem from its slow pace and unconventional narrative structure. It's a book that requires patience, but its beauty lies in its subtlety and the gradual unveiling of its mysteries.",
