Based on the TO780X-Pro, I see that a common issue is a faulty power supply unit, which might explain the flickering display. Before suggesting any advanced steps, since you've already tried the standard troubleshooting, I'd recommend contacting our warranty department. We can arrange a repair or replacement depending on your warranty coverage. Please provide the original purchase date, and I can initiate the process for you.",
