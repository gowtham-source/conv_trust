The skills you've developed at the coffee shop \u2013 customer service, time management, problem-solving \u2013 are valuable.

Then, research different careers related to those interests, and begin to look for introductory courses. Finally, it would be ideal to obtain some experience in the field through things like volunteering, or shadowing. If you tell me some interests of yours, I could start looking for some careers.",
