'Workmanlike quality', while subjective, generally implies a standard of work reasonably expected of a skilled professional in the construction industry. Documenting the poor quality with photos and potentially a professional assessment would be beneficial. As a next step, have you formally notified the company of your concerns in writing?",

It might be viewed as taking action without giving the original contractor a reasonable opportunity to rectify the situation, which could weaken your claim.

Keep detailed records of all communication and expenses related to this matter. ",

Generally, 30-60 days from the date of the 'notice of breach' is a common starting point for negotiation. After this period, if they have not made a good faith effort to resolve the issues, you can consider other options.
