For more affordable options that still capture the minimalist aesthetic, check out Everlane, ASOS Design, or even some options from Nordstrom's house brands. They often carry simpler styles at lower price points. Alternatively, you could also search for 'minimalist sneakers' or 'Scandi-inspired boots' on sites like Zappos and filter by price.",
