      "utterance": "Understood. Based on your preferences for road running, approximately 20 miles per week, and cushioning, I can suggest the following options:\n\n*   **Hoka Clifton 9:** Known for exceptional cushioning and comfort, a great choice for road running.\n*   **Brooks Glycerin 20:** Provides excellent cushioning and a smooth ride.  \n*   **Saucony Triumph 21:** Offers a good balance of cushioning and responsiveness.\n\nThe mileage information helps us gauge the durability needed in the shoe and tailor our recommendations to your level of running. Higher mileage runners might need more durable shoes. Does this make sense?  I also recommend reading reviews of each shoe before purchasing to ensure the best fit for your feet.",
