Both explore themes of control, autonomy, and the nature of reality. 'The Matrix' delves deeper into simulated reality and existentialism, questioning what is real and the nature of choice. 'Upgrade', while also dealing with control and autonomy via technological enhancement, focuses more on revenge, justice, and the potentially dehumanizing effects of technology. The core difference lies in 'The Matrix' exploring the nature of reality itself, while 'Upgrade' focuses on the consequences of technological dependence and the blurring lines between man and machine in a more grounded, albeit still fictional, setting.
