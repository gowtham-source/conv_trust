Generally, these include the processing time in our warehouse (typically a day or two), the shipping carrier's transit time (which varies depending on the shipping method you selected), any potential delays with the carrier itself (like weather or high-volume periods), and the final destination relative to our warehouse location. Also, the stock situation and time of the order is crucial to determine processing time.",
