I could also suggest 'Project Hail Mary' by Andy Weir (2021) as it is well received, but perhaps you've already read it. Alternatively, 'The Echo Wife' by Sarah Gailey (2021) has received critical acclaim and is less mainstream. Would you like any further information on these, or would you like me to dig deeper?",
