I have a degree in computer science and have worked as a software developer for three years, focusing on web development. But honestly, I have no idea how to translate all of that into a cover letter that will actually impress anyone. I've looked at some templates online, but they all seem so generic and boring. How do I make it stand out?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! To make your cover letter stand out, focus on three key areas: 1) **Personalization**: Address the hiring manager by name if possible (research on LinkedIn is a great start!). 2) **Highlight Relevant Skills**: Tailor the skills to the specific job description. Don't just list them; give examples. 3) **Quantify Your Achievements**: Use numbers to show the impact of your work (e.g., 'Improved website loading speed by 20%'). Regarding the generic templates, they can be a starting point but definitely personalize and adapt them. Show them how your experience and skills align with InnovateTech's needs. But... I'm still under development and am not able to actually *write* the cover letter for you, but hopefully this advice helps! If you'd like, I can generate some bullet points based on a job description to assist in identifying key skills. Also, do you have the job description?",
