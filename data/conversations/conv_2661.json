My similarity recommendations are based on analyzing musical characteristics such as tempo, instrumentation, harmonic structure, and listener behavior data from large music libraries. While Miami Nights 1984 shares core synthwave elements, I understand your distinction regarding song structure. Perhaps focusing more strictly on melodic, vocal-driven synthwave would be better?
