      "utterance": "That's a very specific and excellent challenge! Finding that exact blend outside of Chiang can be tricky. While not a perfect match for *every* element, you might explore 'Permutation City' by Greg Egan, which deals extensively with simulated consciousness and identity in a hard science context. Another possibility is 'Diaspora', also by Greg Egan, which delves into post-human evolution and complex physics. They lean heavily on hard sci-fi but engage with profound philosophical questions, though perhaps less focused solely on individual human consciousness than Chiang's work sometimes is. It's a difficult niche to fill!",
