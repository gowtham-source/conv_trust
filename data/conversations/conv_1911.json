If you don't have shut-off valves, you will need to turn off the water at the main water supply, which could be in your basement or outside. Next, place a towel under the supply lines to catch any remaining water. Use an adjustable wrench to loosen the nuts connecting the supply lines to the old faucet. *Important Note*: The type of supply line connections (compression, push-fit, etc.) will affect how you disconnect them. If you could send me a picture of the existing connections, I can give you more specific advice. Finally, carefully disconnect the lines. You might encounter some residual water pressure, so be prepared for a little water spillage. Let me know if you need more help with the faucet removal, I can walk you through it.",
