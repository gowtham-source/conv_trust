Look for hackathons that explicitly mention this. Alternatively, some hackathon organizers have a Discord server or forum where participants can connect beforehand. As for React-focused hackathons, a quick search using keywords like 'React hackathon' or 'web development hackathon' should yield some results. I can do that for you now if you'd like. Also, consider attending online workshops before the hackathon to refresh your React skills. This can help when you join the team.",

Even a small improvement to an existing service can be a worthwhile hackathon project. Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best implemented.",

      "utterance": "That's a valid concern. The key is communication. Be upfront with your team about your current skill level and your desire to learn. Offer to take on tasks that align with your existing skills while also expressing interest in tackling something new with guidance. For instance, you could say, 'I'm comfortable with component design in React, but I'd love to learn more about Redux. Could I work on a component that uses Redux with some help from someone more experienced?' Most teams are understanding and appreciate proactive learners. Focus on learning *by doing*, but always prioritize the team's progress and be mindful of deadlines. Set realistic goals for yourself and communicate any difficulties you face promptly.",
