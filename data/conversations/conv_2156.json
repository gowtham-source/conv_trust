Based on your past purchases, which include several pairs of Adidas running shoes and some Asics Gel-Kayano models, I recommend you consider the Adidas Ultraboost 23 or the New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v13. Both are highly rated and cater to neutral pronation, which seems to be your preference.",

The Fresh Foam X 880v13 is more focused on durability and a comfortable everyday feel, so more suitable for shorter runs or everyday use. Both have a standard fit, but the Ultraboost tends to run a little snugger. I recommend checking out a sizing chart before ordering, since I can't *actually* know your foot size...",
