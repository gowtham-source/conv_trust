Primarily, I analyze genre tags from music databases, looking for overlaps between 'ambient,' 'electronica,' and related subgenres. I also consider listener behavior data, such as what songs users who enjoy Tycho also listen to. Additionally, I filter for less mainstream artists based on their popularity scores and mentions in independent music blogs and online communities. Finally, I check critical reception.
