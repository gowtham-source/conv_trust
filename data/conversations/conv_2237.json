You could lean towards roles that emphasize content strategy and community engagement, which may align better with your interests. As for exploring these roles, you could start by updating your resume to highlight your transferable skills, such as your creative abilities and presentation experience. Then, search for relevant job postings on sites like LinkedIn and Indeed. Consider networking with professionals in those fields as well. I can also provide you with templates for your resume.",

You possess transferable skills and industry knowledge that can be leveraged. You could supplement your experience with relevant certifications or courses, to strengthen your credentials. While you might not start at the very top, your experience gives you a solid foundation to build on. Focus on highlighting your achievements and transferable skills in your resume and cover letter, and be prepared to explain why you're making the transition. The biggest challenge will be breaking through the initial hurdle, but your existing skills will give you a leg up on others trying to do the same thing.",
