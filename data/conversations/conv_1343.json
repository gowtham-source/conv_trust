Another option, though potentially stretching the budget slightly, is the Jabra Elite 45h. They don't offer as much noise cancellation, but they're known for their comfort and call quality. Which of these sounds best?",

I've checked the recent pricing and it should be comfortably within your budget. The main differences are in sound quality and, some users report, in the overall fit. The Anker's noise cancellation is more effective, but the Philips have a better sound profile to start. I'd also suggest the TaoTronics TT-BH085, if you can find it at a good price. Any of these work?",

The Philips PH805 offers up to 30 hours of battery life with noise cancellation on, while the Anker Q30 offers around 40 hours. So, the Anker has a slight edge in battery life. However, battery life can change depending on usage of noise cancellation. Are you interested in either of those options?",
