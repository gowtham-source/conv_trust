Unplug them both from the power outlet, wait 30 seconds, plug the modem back in first, wait for it to fully connect, then plug the router back in. After your router is online, see if the hub connects normally.",

Some routers offer Quality of Service (QoS) settings that allow you to prioritize network traffic to specific devices. Consult your router's manual or your internet service provider's support for specific instructions on configuring QoS. I can also provide you with a general guide if you provide the make and model of your router.",
