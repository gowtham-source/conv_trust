While not noise-canceling, they offer excellent sound quality for the price and have a very similar design style to the Sonys. They also tend to be more readily discounted.

I use a combination of factors to make recommendations, including user reviews (including those that specifically compare different products), expert reviews from trusted sources, and specifications like frequency response. However, I acknowledge that these are not a substitute for a personal listening experience. I strongly encourage you to read detailed reviews and, where possible, check return policies in case the headphones don't meet your expectations. I apologize that I can't provide a perfect substitute for testing, but I hope the provided information will help in your search.",
