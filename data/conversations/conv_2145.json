Here are some common interview questions related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with some tips on how to answer them:\n\n*   **\"What is OOP?\"** (Explain the core principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.)\n*   **\"What are the benefits of using OOP?\"** (Discuss code reusability, maintainability, and organization.)\n*   **\"Explain the difference between inheritance and polymorphism.\"** (Provide clear examples.)\n\nFor your answer, tailor it to the interviewer. If they seem junior, give a simpler answer. If they seem more advanced, you can use more technical jargon. Do you want me to elaborate on these?",

      "utterance": "Okay, let's try this. Imagine a base class 'Animal'. Inheritance means creating a class like 'Dog' or 'Cat' that inherits properties from 'Animal' (e.g., has a name, eats food). Polymorphism, in this context, would be how the 'makeSound()' method, when called on a 'Dog' object, produces a 'Woof' sound, while on a 'Cat' object, it produces a 'Meow' sound. Different classes can have the same method name, but the implementation is different based on the class type. Does that help?",
