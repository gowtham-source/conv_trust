For deeper world-building and a darker tone with less emphasis on romance, you might enjoy 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' by Scott Lynch, which features intricate world details and a gritty, character-driven plot.

While 'A Song of Ice and Fire' (Game of Thrones) shares many characteristics with grimdark \u2013 moral complexity, dark themes, violence \u2013 it often includes elements of traditional high fantasy, such as clear magical forces and epic scale battles that involve more traditional fantasy tropes. Grimdark tends to lean even further into cynicism, deconstruction of heroic archetypes, and a generally more hopeless worldview. The lines are definitely debated by readers and critics.",

It's a wonderfully warm and hopeful fantasy novel with a charming story and found family themes. 'Legends & Lattes' by Travis Baldree is another excellent choice, often described as 'cozy fantasy,' focusing on a retired adventurer opening a coffee shop.",
