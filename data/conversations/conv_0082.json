Combat is minimal, and the focus is on solving a murder mystery through your character's internal thoughts and interactions with the world. Think less action, more detective work and philosophical pondering.",

As for my recommendation system, I use a combination of collaborative filtering based on user reviews and content-based filtering based on game descriptions and tags. This is combined with a rule-based system where I look for keywords related to your request, such as 'story-rich RPG.' I can't provide specifics on proprietary algorithms, of course, but that gives you a general idea.",
