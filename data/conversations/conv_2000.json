However, you can look at the materials used (full-grain leather is generally more durable than synthetic), and read reviews to gauge the experiences of other buyers. For brands, Adidas and similar are generally budget-friendly, while Common Projects are higher-end. Brands like Thursday Boots are a popular middle ground, known for quality at a reasonable price. I would recommend checking out reviews on those brands to see if those shoes are the right fit for you. ",
