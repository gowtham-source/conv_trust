Algorithms rely on tagged metadata, user listening history (if available), and often, collaborative filtering (what other people with similar tastes enjoy). To get closer, I recommend using a music streaming service like Spotify or Apple Music and creating playlists, and then you can tell the service that you like or dislike a song. As you refine it, the recommendations should improve.",
