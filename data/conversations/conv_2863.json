      "utterance": "Finding affordable last-minute flights can be challenging, but I'll do my best. Regarding connecting in Atlanta (ATL), while it is a large airport, airlines typically set a minimum connection time (MCT) based on typical passenger flow. For domestic connections at ATL, the MCT is usually around 45-50 minutes, assuming your arriving flight is on time and you don't need to change terminals requiring the Plane Train or re-clear security (which isn't common for standard domestic connections). However, allowing at least 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes provides a much more comfortable buffer, especially if there are any minor delays or if you are unfamiliar with the airport layout. Always check the specific airline's recommended connection time for your itinerary.",
