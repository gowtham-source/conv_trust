It's an improvement over simply stating 'helped customers' because it frames your action in terms of its positive objective (client satisfaction). Hiring managers look for candidates who understand the importance of positive outcomes, even when specific numbers aren't available. We can explore other phrasing options if you prefer, perhaps focusing on the complexity of issues handled or the volume of support provided, if those apply.",
