It's a bit more meta and deals with a writer's struggle with plagiarism. The reviews are very positive. Alternatively, 'Dark Matter' by Blake Crouch is a thrilling sci-fi thriller with multiple realities, but it may or may not fit your exact genre request, so I am unsure. Do either of those interest you?",
