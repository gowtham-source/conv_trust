Given your income and debt, a good first step would be to focus on paying down that credit card debt as quickly as possible. High-interest debt can significantly hinder your progress toward your other goals. Once that's addressed, we can evaluate your current investment allocation and explore strategies for maximizing your returns while staying within your risk comfort zone. I can generate a few example investment portfolios for you based on your age and risk tolerance; would you like to see those?",
