While *Everything Everywhere All at Once* is lauded for its unique and creative storytelling, and *Nope* for its social commentary through the horror genre, *The Creator* leans more heavily on visual spectacle and explores themes of artificial intelligence and human connection. The artistic merits are subjective, of course, but *The Creator* is visually stunning and presents a compelling narrative, albeit with some familiar tropes. I'd suggest checking out some reviews for a better comparison.",
