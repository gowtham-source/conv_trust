Typically, a semi-gloss or gloss finish is used on trim for durability and easier cleaning. As for when to paint it...it's best to paint the trim first, then the walls. This is because it's easier to tape off the trim after it's painted, and any wall paint that gets on the trim can be easily wiped off while it's still wet.",
