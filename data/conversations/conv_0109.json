A 401(k) is typically offered through your employer, and contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account where you contribute after-tax dollars, but your earnings and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, but you must meet certain income criteria. Without knowing additional information, it is not possible to recommend one over the other.",
