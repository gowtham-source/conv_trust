Stability shoes, like the 1080v13, offer additional support to control overpronation (when your foot rolls inward excessively). If you're unsure, it's often best to get your gait analyzed at a running store. Sometimes the difference feels very subtle, and it depends on your specific needs. Good luck with your shoe search!",
