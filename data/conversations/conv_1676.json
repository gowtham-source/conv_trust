      "utterance": "That's a great question. Generally, paying off high-interest debt, like credit cards, should be a priority, as the interest rates can erode your savings faster than investment returns may generate. However, the best approach also depends on the specific interest rates of your debt and the potential returns of any investment you are considering. Given your situation, I would suggest focusing heavily on paying down the credit card debt while building a small emergency fund, then looking into investment options. I can provide further insights if you would like to explore these options in detail or if you have any further questions.",
