If the tenant pays the full amount of rent due within those three days, the landlord is usually required to accept the payment and the eviction process related to that specific notice should stop.

      "utterance": "That's a critical point. Generally, a notice to pay or quit is considered served on the day it is properly delivered to you, following specific legal procedures. The 3-day period usually begins the day after proper service. Whether payment made before service invalidates a notice can depend on the exact sequence of events and local court interpretation. It's not a simple yes or no, as the notice is for *unpaid* rent. If it was paid *before* the notice was validly served, it raises questions about the notice's premise. However, specific legal validity depends on many factors.",

Unfortunately, determining the definitive legal validity of the notice in your specific situation requires interpreting your actions, the landlord's actions, and applying California law precisely.
