The Bahia Resort Hotel does not include complimentary breakfast, however the 'Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa' does and fits all other specifications. To answer your question on ranking, our algorithm considers several factors including price, guest reviews, popularity (booking frequency), location proximity to your specified area, and the amenities you've selected. We also factor in promotional offers and availability. We do not explicitly prioritize review scores above other factors, but hotels with consistently high ratings tend to rank higher overall due to their popularity and positive guest experiences. Does either hotel option interest you?",
