To find the area, you need to identify those shapes, calculate the area of each individual shape, and then add them together. For example, if you have a figure that looks like a rectangle with a triangle on top, you'd find the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle, and then add those two areas to get the total area of the composite figure. Do you have a specific example in mind that we could work through together?",

The shared side doesn't inherently change the area calculation. You would however need to know the dimensions of the triangle (base and height). The base would now be the length of the side of the triangle that is joined with the rest of the figure.",
