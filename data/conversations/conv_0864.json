Linoleum can sometimes be tiled over if it's properly adhered and in good condition, but it's often better to remove it to inspect the subfloor for damage (like water damage, which is common in bathrooms). If the subfloor is plywood, ensure it's at least 3/4 inch thick. If it's concrete, check for cracks and levelness. Uneven surfaces will need to be addressed with a self-leveling compound.",

      "utterance": "That's a fair question. Try tapping on the linoleum in various spots. If you hear hollow sounds or feel any give, it's likely not well-adhered and should be removed. Also, check the seams around the edges of the linoleum. If they are lifting or cracked, it's another sign of potential problems underneath. If the linoleum feels solid and uniformly bonded to the subfloor, and the seams are tight, it *might* be okay to tile over. However, keep in mind that tiling over existing linoleum is generally considered a shortcut and can increase the risk of future problems like cracking or tile separation.
