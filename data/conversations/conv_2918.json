For smart casual occasions, versatile options like loafers, Chelsea boots, or even some sleek leather low-top sneakers are often recommended. They strike a good balance between relaxed and polished without being overly formal or athletic. Which of these sounds closest to what you have in mind?",

This style exists, and they are designed to be more refined than typical athletic sneakers. They often feature simple designs, premium materials like fine leather or suede, and slim profiles. Brands focusing on contemporary or minimalist aesthetics often carry this type of shoe. For comfort for standing, look for descriptions mentioning cushioned insoles or ergonomic designs.",
