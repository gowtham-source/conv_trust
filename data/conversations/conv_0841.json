North-facing rooms tend to be cooler, so a warmer gray might be preferable. South-facing rooms get more sunlight, so a cooler gray can balance that. Also, think about the existing furniture and decor. Do you want a gray that complements or contrasts with those elements? Finally, I'd recommend getting a few sample cans and painting swatches on different walls in the room to see how the color looks in various lighting conditions throughout the day. Does that help?",

      "utterance": "To avoid purple undertones in gray paint, look for grays with a green or yellow undertone. Check the paint's color code or ask a paint specialist at your local hardware store to help you identify options that lean away from purple. Online reviews can be helpful too, to see if other people have reported purple undertones in specific paints. Remember lighting can play a huge role. Testing samples is essential to see how the paint looks in *your* room. Good luck!",
