They can deduct for damages above normal wear and tear, unpaid rent, or cleaning necessary to return the unit to the condition it was in at the beginning of the tenancy. They must return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within 21 days of you moving out. Normal wear and tear is generally considered to be the expected deterioration that occurs with ordinary use over time.",

When negotiations with the landlord aren't successful regarding unwarranted deductions, the next steps typically involve legal action. This often means filing a case in small claims court to recover the disputed amount. However, initiating legal proceedings is complex and requires careful consideration of rules and evidence. As I cannot provide legal advice or tell you what specific actions to take, I strongly recommend consulting with a qualified attorney or a legal aid organization in California who can review your specific situation and advise you on the best course of action and the necessary steps.",

      "utterance": "Before filing a lawsuit, it is common to send a formal demand letter to the landlord outlining your position and demanding the return of the disputed funds. This can sometimes resolve the issue without going to court. The letter should clearly state the amount you believe is owed and why the deductions are improper, potentially referencing relevant California law if you are familiar with it. To find a lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant law in California, you can contact the State Bar of California or local county bar associations for referral services. Many areas also have legal aid societies that offer free or low-cost assistance to eligible individuals.",
