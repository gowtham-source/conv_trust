They're all well-regarded for road running and are generally comfortable. They typically fit within your budget. However, I am not able to account for your specific foot type and pronation, so it would be wise to go to a store to try some on before you buy, and to ask for their expert advice.",

Unfortunately, I don't have direct access to your past purchase history, and cannot take into account your specific foot shape, pronation type, or prior shoe experiences. The recommendations are based on general popularity and the stated features suitable for road running, and the price point. Ultimately, trying on a pair is the best approach for avoiding blisters.
