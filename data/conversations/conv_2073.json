Try using metrics like percentage improvements (e.g., 'Improved code efficiency by 15%'), cost savings (e.g., 'Reduced cloud spending by $5,000 per month'), or project completion time reduction. Even if it's team work, try phrases like, 'Led a team of X developers to successfully deploy…' or 'Contributed to a project that resulted in…'. I can help you brainstorm more specific ways to quantify your experience, just provide me the project details.",
