Think about what problems you're interested in solving or technologies you want to learn. Then, team up with others! Collaboration is key. Finally, don't be afraid to ask for help during the event - mentors are there for you.",

An image classifier using pre-trained models (like on TensorFlow or PyTorch) to categorize images. 3. A sentiment analysis tool to gauge reactions to text. These are all doable within a hackathon timeframe. You could also explore using AI to analyze a dataset provided by the hackathon organizers.",

As for learning sentiment analysis quickly, start with the basics of NLP (Natural Language Processing).  There are tutorials on platforms like Kaggle, or you can use Python libraries like NLTK or spaCy.  They provide pre-built functions.  Good luck!",
