      "utterance": "That's a great question. Resume gaps, especially for personal reasons like travel or family, are becoming more common and accepted. The best approach is to be honest and frame it positively. In your cover letter (briefly) or interview, you can mention that you took a planned break for personal enrichment or to pursue an important personal goal. Highlight any skills gained during that time, like adaptability, cross-cultural communication, or planning. Avoid being apologetic. Focus on how you're now refreshed and eager to apply your skills.",
