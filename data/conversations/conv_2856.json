The best approach is to be honest and frame it positively. In your cover letter (briefly) or interview, you can mention that you took a planned break for personal enrichment or to pursue an important personal goal. Highlight any skills gained during that time, like adaptability, cross-cultural communication, or planning. Avoid being apologetic. Focus on how you're now refreshed and eager to apply your skills.",
