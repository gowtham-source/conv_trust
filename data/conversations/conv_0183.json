Unlike Skyrim's more forgiving system, your decisions have significant consequences and can affect your reputation and the game's narrative. Character development is skill-based and realistic; you learn by doing, meaning your success in combat relies on actual practice and not just leveling up. The game allows for significant freedom in approaching quests and developing your character, arguably offering more impactful choices than Skyrim, although it can be less accessible due to its more demanding gameplay.",
