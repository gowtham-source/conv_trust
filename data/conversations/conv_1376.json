Their tortillas are also made from scratch. However, tacos are still tacos, so portion size and fillings will affect how healthy the meal is. They also offer smoothies which are on the healthier side. I'd say it depends on your specific dietary needs and how you customize your order. I can provide nutritional information for specific menu items if you want.",
