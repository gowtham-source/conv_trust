In general, if a contract is so vague that it's unenforceable, it might be difficult for the plaintiff to win. However, this depends heavily on the specific language of the contract and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. Also, courts can interpret ambiguous language. You could raise this issue of vagueness as a defense in your Answer. It is strongly suggested that you consult with a lawyer for clarification, and to get legal advice tailored to your situation.
