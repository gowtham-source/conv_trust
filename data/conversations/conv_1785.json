For strategy, 'Civilization VI' and 'Stellaris' are great choices. Would you like more information on any of these, or perhaps some suggestions from different genres?",

However, compared to other grand strategy games, it has a more streamlined tutorial and some very good quality of life features. There are also plenty of online resources and guides, and a very active community, which can help with learning the game. That being said, the complexity is the reason why Stellaris is one of the most loved games of the genre... If you are looking for something easier, you may want to try something else. Perhaps 'Age of Wonders 4', a fantasy strategy game with a more forgiving gameplay?",
