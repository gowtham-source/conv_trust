A medical necessity denial (often linked to M80) requires an appeal with supporting clinical documentation from the patient's chart that demonstrates the service was indeed necessary based on their condition and the payer's medical policies. You will likely need to submit a written appeal and relevant chart notes to the address specified on the EOB or the payer's website.",
