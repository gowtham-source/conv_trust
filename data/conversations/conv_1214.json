Think about problems you encounter in your daily life or areas you're passionate about. Look at the hackathon's themes or sponsors for inspiration. Once you have a few ideas, research existing solutions to see what gaps you can fill or how you can improve upon them. Another strategy can be to leverage existing AI products or services for your project. Does that help?",
