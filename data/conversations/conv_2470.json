For RPGs with a strong story, I'd suggest titles like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Cyberpunk 2077, or maybe even something like Disco Elysium if you're into a unique narrative experience. For action-adventure, you can't go wrong with the God of War series, Marvel's Spider-Man games, or The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (if you have a Switch).",

Dark Souls III is a classic action RPG with customization and a dark setting, but maybe not 'deep customization' in the character build sense some players want. Elden Ring is similar but more open world. Path of Exile is a free-to-play action RPG with incredibly deep customization trees, though it leans more towards loot-focused gameplay than a traditional narrative structure.",

While not strictly 'dark fantasy' in the same vein as Dark Souls, Baldur's Gate 3 might be worth considering. It's a critically acclaimed RPG on PC with deep character customization and a rich narrative, although its combat is turn-based rather than pure action. It blends elements you like.",
