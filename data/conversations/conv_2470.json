Dark Souls III is a classic action RPG with customization and a dark setting, but maybe not 'deep customization' in the character build sense some players want. Elden Ring is similar but more open world. Path of Exile is a free-to-play action RPG with incredibly deep customization trees, though it leans more towards loot-focused gameplay than a traditional narrative structure.",

While not strictly 'dark fantasy' in the same vein as Dark Souls, Baldur's Gate 3 might be worth considering. It's a critically acclaimed RPG on PC with deep character customization and a rich narrative, although its combat is turn-based rather than pure action. It blends elements you like.",
