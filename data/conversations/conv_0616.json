For example, you could consider a large batch of lentil soup, which is very affordable and nutritious. Or perhaps some simple rice and bean bowls with salsa. I can provide more detailed recipes and cost estimates if you'd like. Also, what kind of diet are you following, if any?",

      "utterance": "Alright, I understand. Let's see... Instead of rice and beans, perhaps you could consider pasta-based dishes. Pasta is generally inexpensive. A simple tomato sauce made from canned tomatoes, garlic, and olive oil can be quite affordable. You could also add some ground turkey or chicken if your budget allows, which is a good source of protein. It depends on the store location, but a pound of pasta should be around $1, a large can of crushed tomatoes around $2, and ground turkey maybe $5-$7/lb. Then you can also consider egg-drop soup. Eggs are cheap. Would you like more details?",
