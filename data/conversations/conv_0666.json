Over-the-counter cough suppressants like dextromethorphan or expectorants like guaifenesin *might* provide some relief, but they only treat the symptoms, not the underlying cause. The chest pain, combined with the length of time you've had the cough, does warrant further investigation. While I cannot provide a diagnosis, given your symptoms, a visit to your doctor is recommended to rule out more serious conditions and receive appropriate treatment. COVID-19 is a possibility, so testing is advisable. Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
