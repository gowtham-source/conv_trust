However, based on some reviews, the Anker might have a slightly more balanced sound profile, especially for the price. The Jabra is a solid all-around choice. I recommend reading a few professional reviews that go into the specifics of sound quality for your desired headphones.",

Considering your budget and preferences, I would lean towards the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 or even consider stretching your budget just a little for a model like the Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT (which might go on sale, or you can find refurbished units in good condition within your budget). The Audio-Technica models are great for clarity.",
