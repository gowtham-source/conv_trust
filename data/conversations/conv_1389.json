The lack of exercise, irregular meals, and high caffeine intake, coupled with the stress of your job, can certainly lead to fatigue and headaches. I recommend prioritizing regular meals, even if it's just a quick snack, and incorporating some form of physical activity into your routine. Perhaps taking short breaks to walk around throughout the day could help. Consider reducing your caffeine intake and staying hydrated. This alone might provide some relief.",

For example, try a short walk outside for some fresh air and sunlight. Drink a glass of water to ensure you're hydrated.

Remember, however, these are temporary measures, and addressing the root causes of your fatigue is crucial for long-term well-being. As a friendly reminder, I'm still under development.",
