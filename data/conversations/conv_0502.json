Given your symptoms \u2013 dry cough, intermittent fever, and muscle aches \u2013 it's difficult to say definitively what's causing them without a proper examination. Possible causes could range from a viral infection like influenza to something else entirely. I strongly advise you to consult with a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can assess your condition and rule out anything serious. In the meantime, continue to rest, stay hydrated, and consider using a humidifier to ease your cough.",
