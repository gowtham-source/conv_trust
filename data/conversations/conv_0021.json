Try the 'rubber duck debugging' method - explain your code line by line to an inanimate object (or a teammate). Often, just articulating the problem helps you find the solution. Second, don't be afraid to ask for help! Hackathons often have mentors available who can provide guidance. Third, if you're truly stuck, consider scaling back your project.
