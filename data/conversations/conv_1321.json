In simpler terms, in a system where no external forces are acting, the momentum before an event (like a collision) equals the momentum after the event.

(3)  Apply conservation of momentum: 10 kg m/s = 5 kg * v_final. (4) Solve for v_final: v_final = 2 m/s. The combined velocity after the collision is 2 m/s.  The negative sign you may have gotten could be from assigning incorrect directions at the outset. It's a good idea to start with positive directions, then correct your thinking if it doesn't work.",
