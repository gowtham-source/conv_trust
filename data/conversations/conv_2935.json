Then you rewrite the 'bx' term using those numbers and factor by grouping. Alternatively, the quadratic formula always works, regardless of 'a' or if it's factorable.

If it's zero, there's exactly one real solution (a repeated root). If it's negative, it means there are no real number solutions because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the real number system. So, yes, it indicates no solutions in terms of real numbers.",
