The denial code is CO-97, which I think means 'The benefit for this service is included in the payment/allowance for another service/procedure that has already been adjudicated.' And the diagnosis codes are usually something like E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) or I10 (Essential [primary] hypertension). But how can it be included in another service when it's just a standard follow-up visit? This makes no sense!",

To confirm, could you check if any other procedures were billed for these patients on the same date of service? If so, it may be necessary to appeal the denial, emphasizing the distinct nature of each service provided and justifying the medical necessity of both. I can provide appeal template examples if needed.",
