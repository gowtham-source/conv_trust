Generally, RPGs involve character progression, narrative choices that impact the story, and often a focus on world-building and player choice. While Outer Wilds lacks traditional combat or skill trees, its strong narrative focus, exploration-based 'progression' of knowledge, and intricate world are why some categorize it broadly with RPGs, though it's certainly not a typical example.",

      "utterance": "Hmm, I appreciate the explanation, but I'm still not sold on Outer Wilds as fitting what I'm looking for in an RPG. And I tried Citizen Sleeper, it was too text-heavy and slow for my taste. I was really hoping for that indie sci-fi vibe but with some actual combat or more active traditional RPG mechanics. Is there *anything* else that fits that criteria? Feeling a little frustrated here.",

      "utterance": "My apologies, it sounds like I haven't quite hit the mark yet. Finding that specific combination of indie sci-fi RPG with tactical combat can be challenging. Let me try a different approach. Consider games like Wasteland 3 (it's post-apocalyptic sci-fi and has deep tactical combat, though not strictly indie) or perhaps Encased: A Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic RPG. If those are still not quite right, I can refine the search further, perhaps focusing on 'CRPGs' with a sci-fi theme.",
