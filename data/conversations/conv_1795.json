I'm not too picky beyond that. Something that's not going to break the bank would be great too. Honestly, I'm a little frustrated; I've spent hours looking already!",

      "utterance": "Understood. Based on your preferences, I recommend the Asics GEL-Kayano 29 for its excellent cushioning and stability, ideal for road running. It's a popular model, so you can often find it at a decent price. Alternatively, the New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v13 is another excellent option known for its comfort and durability. \n\nHowever, I'm also seeing some conflicting information in my database. Some customer reviews for the GEL-Kayano 29 mention a slight increase in the price in the last month. Can you tell me how accurate the price information is on the website currently? I am unsure if I can show you the correct pricing right now.",
