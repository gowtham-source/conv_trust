While both offer a minimalist aesthetic, the Common Projects Achilles Low is generally considered to be of higher quality due to the premium Italian leather and construction. The Adidas Stan Smith is a durable shoe with good value for money. The price difference is a matter of perception, but you're essentially paying more for higher quality materials and craftsmanship in the Common Projects shoe. You could also consider quality differences to include aspects of the shoe\u2019s durability and long term maintenance; this means considering how long the shoes will last, and also how much it would cost to repair each pair.",
