How about these options? 1) Lentil soup (very budget-friendly and nutritious), 2) Chicken and rice with roasted vegetables (chicken thighs are cheaper than breasts), and 3) Pasta with a simple tomato sauce and canned beans. I can generate a sample shopping list focusing on these options if you'd like.",
