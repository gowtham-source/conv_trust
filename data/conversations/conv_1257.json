I can also suggest how to track these expenses.",

They can connect to your accounts and automatically track spending. Let's also look at your student loans - are you on an income-driven repayment plan? That could potentially lower your payments if you qualify. Additionally, we could explore strategies for building an emergency fund, even if it's a small amount initially. Also, what is your total outstanding student loan debt?",

Check your loan servicer's website or call them. Regarding interest rates, federal student loans usually have fixed interest rates. However, if your credit is strong, you could explore refinancing with a private lender to potentially secure a lower rate. The best choice depends on your specific situation. I recommend researching this carefully. I can provide you with some resources, such as the Department of Education's website, to help you understand your options, if you'd like.",
