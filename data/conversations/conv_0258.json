What programming languages or tools are you comfortable with? Knowing this will help you choose a hackathon that aligns with your strengths and interests. Also, check out sites like Devpost or Hackathon.io to find upcoming events.",

Try focusing on problems you encounter in your daily life or areas where you think technology could make a real difference. Even a small, well-executed idea is better than a complex one that's half-finished. Also, don't be afraid to look at past hackathon projects for inspiration, just don't directly copy them.

      "utterance": "That's a very valid concern. Similarity to existing projects can be tricky. If your idea has substantial overlap, it's generally best to pivot or find a unique angle. Focus on how your implementation differs, what specific problem your version solves that others don't, or any novel features you add. Highlighting these aspects in your presentation and demo will be key to demonstrating originality and justifying your project. Be transparent about your inspiration, acknowledging similar work, but clearly emphasizing what makes yours different and valuable. Judges often appreciate improvements and new perspectives on existing concepts.",
