For example, instead of saying 'Improved team communication,' you could say 'Implemented daily stand-up meetings and a centralized communication platform, resulting in a reported 15% increase in team collaboration and a reduction in project-related delays.' Even if the number is an estimate, it demonstrates a positive outcome. Or, if you don't have numbers, use strong action verbs and describe the *effect* of your actions: 'Facilitated cross-departmental communication, resolving key roadblocks and accelerating project timelines.'",
