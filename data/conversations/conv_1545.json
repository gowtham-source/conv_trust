      "utterance": "That's a great question. Given your debt situation, it's generally recommended to prioritize paying down high-interest debt, like your student loans, before aggressively investing. The 6% interest on your student loans is likely higher than any returns you'd get in the short term with low risk investments. Once that's under control, we can develop an investment strategy aligned with your risk tolerance. Regarding your mortgage, the 4% interest is relatively low so paying extra might not be the best use of funds. I can provide a detailed debt repayment plan and explore investment options once we've established a solid budget and paid down some of that high-interest debt. Does that sound like a good first step?",
