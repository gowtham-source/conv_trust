To start, could you tell me a bit more about the role and what areas you feel you need the most practice with? For example, are you looking to focus on technical questions, behavioral questions, case studies, or something else?",

I'm okay with the general data science stuff, but I always struggle with behavioral questions, like 'tell me about a challenge' or 'where do you see yourself in 5 years'. Also, I'm worried about their specific coding challenges or theoretical questions on less common topics.",

      "utterance": "That's a very common concern with the 'failure' question. You don't need a catastrophic event. The interviewer is often more interested in your ability to self-reflect, learn from mistakes, and demonstrate resilience. Choose a situation, even a smaller one, where things didn't go as planned due to something you did or didn't do. Clearly explain the situation, your role, what went wrong, and most importantly, what you learned from it and how you applied that learning to future situations. Frame it around growth and lessons learned, not just the negative outcome. Would you like to brainstorm a specific example based on this approach?",
