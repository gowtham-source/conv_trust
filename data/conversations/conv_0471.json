After investigating, it appears there was a promotional offer sent out, and it seems it may have been automatically added to accounts that met certain criteria. I have removed the premium service and credited your account $75. This should reflect in your next billing cycle. As for how it was added without direct consent, the system does not require confirmation under some promotional circumstances, which I understand is not ideal, but I have noted this feedback. Is there anything else I can help you with today?",
