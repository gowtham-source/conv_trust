If you need to store sensitive data for a short period and specific to a single session (e.g., shopping cart data), sessionStorage is ideal. For user preferences that need to persist across sessions (e.g., theme settings), localStorage is suitable. Cookies are best for tracking user behavior and storing small amounts of data that need to be accessible across multiple domains, but keep in mind security concerns, like potential of XSS attacks.",
