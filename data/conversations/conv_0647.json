In that scenario, you would receive a settlement check for the ACV of your vehicle, minus your deductible. However, we can also discuss options like keeping the vehicle and receiving a reduced settlement, but this is subject to policy terms and state regulations. Once the damage assessment is complete, we can explore these options in detail. Does that clarify things for now?",
