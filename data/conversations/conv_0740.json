Consider these options focusing on mix-and-match potential: 1) A neutral-colored midi skirt (think black, navy, or olive) from stores like SHEIN or Amazon for around $20-$30. 2) A couple of basic tops - a fitted knit top and a flowy blouse - in complementary colors (around $15-$20 each). 3) A versatile cardigan or light jacket ($30-$40 from stores like Target or Old Navy). 4) Comfortable sneakers or flats in a neutral color ($40-$60). This leaves some room for accessories from thrift stores or affordable retailers. How does this sound so far?",
