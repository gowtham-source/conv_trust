Regarding carbon emissions, that is a more complex question. While I don't have precise carbon footprint data for each specific flight at this moment, generally speaking, direct flights tend to have a lower carbon footprint compared to connecting flights due to less fuel consumption during takeoff and landing. Once I find some suitable flight options, I can guide you towards resources that offer more detailed emissions information for those specific airlines or aircraft types. Would you like me to proceed with the flight search now?",
