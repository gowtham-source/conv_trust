The reason there isn't a simple rule for log(x+y) is because the logarithm function doesn't 'distribute' over addition in the way that it relates to multiplication and division through its inverse, exponentiation. The properties log(xy) and log(x/y) come directly from the rules of exponents (like a^m * a^n = a^(m+n)), and there isn't a corresponding simple rule for adding bases or exponents when sums are involved inside the logarithm.",
