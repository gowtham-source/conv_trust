      "utterance": "That's a common point of confusion! The reason there isn't a simple rule for log(x+y) is because the logarithm function doesn't 'distribute' over addition in the way that it relates to multiplication and division through its inverse, exponentiation. The properties log(xy) and log(x/y) come directly from the rules of exponents (like a^m * a^n = a^(m+n)), and there isn't a corresponding simple rule for adding bases or exponents when sums are involved inside the logarithm.",

You usually calculate the sum inside first if possible. In more advanced mathematics, like calculus, you might encounter series expansions that approximate the logarithm of a sum under certain conditions, but for typical simplification, there isn't a rule.",

If x and y are variables, you generally cannot simplify log(x+y) using the standard properties.
