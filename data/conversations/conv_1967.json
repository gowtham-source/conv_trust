For casual, how about a few basic t-shirts (say, 3 for $60), a pair of dark-wash jeans ($80), and a casual jacket like a denim jacket or a bomber jacket ($70)? That leaves about $90 for the business casual look. For that, we could find a nice blazer and dress pants combo. I can search for specific items within those budgets.",

Perhaps we could focus on finding either a nice blazer or some good dress pants for the business casual look and use what remains of the budget for the other item.  Let me search for some blazers on sale at stores like H&M or ASOS, which often have good options.  Alternatively, we could prioritize finding decent dress pants from a store like Uniqlo, then find a coordinating blazer later.",
