While that song is quite mainstream, The Cardigans' other work, particularly albums like \"Life\" and \"Gran Turismo\", incorporate more indie and alternative rock influences in their instrumentation and songwriting. The slightly darker lyrical themes and overall tone differentiate them from typical bubblegum pop. It's a subtle difference, I admit, but hopefully you'll hear it!",
