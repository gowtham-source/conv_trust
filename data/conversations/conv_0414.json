You can make a flavorful soup with carrots, celery, onion, and some basic spices. Serve it with a side of toasted bread. Another option is pasta with a simple tomato sauce. Canned tomatoes are budget-friendly, and you can add garlic and herbs for flavor. These options should easily fall within your $30 budget, with enough leftovers for multiple meals.

      "utterance": "That's a valid concern! While fresh vegetables generally offer optimal nutritional value and taste, frozen vegetables are often a very close second in terms of nutrients, especially when considering that they are frozen at peak ripeness. Canned vegetables can lose some nutrients during processing, particularly water-soluble vitamins like Vitamin C and B vitamins. However, they are still a good source of fiber and some minerals. In terms of cost, frozen vegetables are often cheaper than fresh, and canned are generally the cheapest option. To maximize nutrition with canned vegetables, try to choose varieties canned in water rather than brine (which can be high in sodium), and include the liquid in your cooking where appropriate. For example, using the liquid from canned tomatoes in your pasta sauce. It will save a bit of money and still provide decent nutrition. Lentils will be your powerhouse though!",
