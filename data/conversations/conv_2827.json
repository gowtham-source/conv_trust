Based on user reviews and features, here are a few options that often fall within that price range:\n\n1. Anker Soundcore Life Q30\n2. Sony WH-CH710N\n3. Jabra Elite 45h (Note: these are on-ear, not over-ear, but have decent ANC)\n\nThese models are known for providing a good balance of noise cancellation and sound quality for their price point. Do any of these sound interesting?",

Finding strong ANC *and* 20+ hours battery strictly under $150 can narrow the field considerably, but let's look. The Mpow H12 (sometimes listed as VANKYO H12) occasionally drops below $150 and offers around 30 hours battery, though its ANC might not be as strong as the Q30. Also, keep an eye out for sales on the models I mentioned earlier.",

      "utterance": "Comparing headphones in the sub-$150 range to premium lines like Bose QuietComfort is difficult, as Bose is generally considered top-tier for ANC performance. The Mpow/VANKYO H12 provides basic noise cancellation that can help with consistent low-frequency sounds like plane engines or bus hum, but it won't block out voices or sharper noises to the same degree as Bose or even the Anker Q30. For commuting, it would offer some reduction but isn't in the same league as higher-end options.",
