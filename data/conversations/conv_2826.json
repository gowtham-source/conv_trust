Blue Cross denied 99214-25 saying it was 'inclusive' or 'bundled' with 11719. But we've *always* been paid for that combination when it's properly documented. Why is this happening now?",

      "utterance": "Thank you for providing the code CO-97. This code indeed indicates the payer considers the service included. While Modifier 25 is used to indicate a separately identifiable E/M service on the same day as a procedure, payers sometimes implement specific bundling edits based on their own clinical guidelines or fee schedules, even if general coding rules allow the combination. It's possible Blue Cross updated their internal edits effective around the date of service, specifically targeting this CPT pair (99214/11719) or certain modifier combinations. You would typically need to review Blue Cross's provider manual updates or bulletin for that specific date range to confirm if such a policy change occurred.",
