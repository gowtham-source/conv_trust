The reason code says 'Missing Authorization'. But we *definitely* had an authorization for this visit. This is so frustrating, how could they miss that?",

      "utterance": "Thank you for providing those details. I see the claim ABC12345 and authorization AUTH67890. While the authorization number was present on the claim in Box 23, sometimes payers, including Blue Shield, have specific electronic submission requirements or internal linking processes that can cause a valid authorization to be initially overlooked. It's possible the authorization was linked to a different patient ID in their system, or there was a data entry error on their end when the auth was issued or processed internally. Reviewing the payer's remittance advice for any further details or contacting Blue Shield directly with the authorization number to confirm its validity and status for that specific date of service would be the best next steps to resolve this.",
