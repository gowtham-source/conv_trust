The main goal is to get all the terms with the variable on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other. We achieve this by using inverse operations. Would you like to go through a simple example to see the process?",

      "utterance": "That's a great, challenging example! Don't worry, those types of equations can seem intimidating, but they follow the same core principles. A very effective first step when dealing with fractions in an equation like that is to multiply *every term* on *both sides* of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) of all the fractions involved. In your example, the denominators are 3 and 2, so the LCD is 6. Multiplying everything by 6 will eliminate the fractions, making the equation much simpler to work with before you tackle the distribution and combining terms. Does that initial step make sense?",
