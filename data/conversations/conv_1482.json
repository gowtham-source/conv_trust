Primarily, we look at your browsing history (products viewed, time spent on pages), past purchases, items in your cart, and any reviews you've left. We also consider broader trends, like what's popular with other users who have similar interests to yours. Regarding how we differ from other e-commerce sites, we use a proprietary algorithm that prioritizes items based on contextual relevance, not just popularity. We also allow you to manually 'tune' your preferences through a 'My Interests' setting. Check it out, you may find it helpful. I'm still learning and improving, but I hope this helps!",
