Based on your preferences, I'll analyze current sales across various stores and look for items that fit your style and size, while staying within your budget. I can also filter by things like material and customer reviews, so you don't end up with something that falls apart after one wash. Give me a few minutes, and I'll generate some outfit suggestions for you.",
