For flights, there's a direct flight with United that leaves on the 12th and returns on the 19th. For hotels, the Hotel Artemide seems like a good fit. It's well-reviewed, centrally located, and fits your budget. Would you like me to provide more details on either the flight or the hotel?",

Regarding quieter options, I see the Hotel Colosseum is available, about a 15-minute walk to the city center and has excellent reviews regarding peacefulness. I'm also researching the cancellation policies for both the flight and Hotel Artemide. I'll have that information for you shortly. The Hotel Colosseum, booking through our platform, allows free cancellation up to 7 days before your arrival. Are you interested in hearing about the flight cancellation policy?",
