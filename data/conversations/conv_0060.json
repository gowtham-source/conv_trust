While it might seem discouraging, the most important thing is that you're starting to address it now. A common recommendation is to aim for 1x your salary saved by age 30, but since you're past that, the next best step is to create a detailed budget and explore strategies for both increasing your savings rate and aggressively paying down that high-interest credit card debt. Would you like assistance with creating a budget? There are a lot of methods for that.",
