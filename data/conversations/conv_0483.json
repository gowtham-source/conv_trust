      "utterance": "Absolutely, there's hope! Many people are in similar situations. Given your debt interest rate, prioritizing paying down your student loans while still contributing enough to your 401k to get any employer match is generally advisable. As for the tax implications, contributions to a traditional 401k are typically made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. This means you'll pay less in taxes now, but you'll pay taxes on the distributions in retirement. The exact amount of tax savings depends on your individual tax bracket.
