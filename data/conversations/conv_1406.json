We offer standard shipping, which is free, and takes 5-7 business days. We also offer expedited shipping (3-5 business days) which can be found in the order checkout.  I can't give you the exact prices, though - these vary depending on your location and the item.  I recommend checking the cart before you commit to purchase!",
