For our simulations, we typically use a conservative inflation rate, often based on historical averages, to project the future value of your investments. We can adjust this to be more or less conservative based on your risk tolerance. To provide the most accurate picture, however, I'll need some more detailed information about your specific 401k plan, including its investment options and fees. Would you be able to provide that, or do you need assistance finding the information?",
