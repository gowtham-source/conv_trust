      "utterance": "That's a great question. Generally, if a scheduled transfer date falls on a weekend or holiday, the transfer will be processed on the *next* business day. Regarding overdraft fees, our system attempts to process transfers even with low balances, potentially triggering an overdraft if sufficient funds aren't available when the transfer is actually processed. To avoid this, ensure your account has enough funds a few days *prior* to the scheduled transfer date. You can also enroll in overdraft protection or link another account to cover potential shortfalls. I recommend reviewing our overdraft policy on the website for more specific details.",
