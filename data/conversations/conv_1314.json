They blend fantasy races and magic with a cyberpunk setting. They are turn-based tactical RPGs, and while the graphics might not be the newest, the stories are really engaging. If you're willing to look at older titles, 'Deus Ex: Human Revolution' might also fit, though it leans more heavily into the cyberpunk side.",
