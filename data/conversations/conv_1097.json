Focus on paying down credit card balances as quickly as possible, as their interest rates are usually much higher than student loans. Then, you can decide between the debt avalanche (highest interest to lowest) or the debt snowball method (smallest balance to largest). The debt avalanche mathematically makes more sense, but the debt snowball can be more motivating, resulting in faster overall repayment. While paying down debt, make minimum payments on your student loans and consider a small amount of retirement savings to get the employer match.",
