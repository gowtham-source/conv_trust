      "utterance": "Alright, $150 for a casual wardrobe update. That's doable! I recommend checking out stores like Old Navy, H&M, and Target. They often have sales and affordable basics. For example, you could probably get a pair of jeans for around $30, a couple of t-shirts for $10-15 each, and a light jacket for around $40-50. This leaves you some wiggle room for accessories or extra items. Does this sound promising?",

They sometimes have discounted items that are slightly higher quality than the basics from the previously mentioned stores. Another option is thrifting! You can often find high-quality, gently used clothing at thrift stores for a fraction of the original price.",
