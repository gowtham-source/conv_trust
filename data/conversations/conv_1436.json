The enforceability of such a clause would likely depend on several factors, including the specific jurisdiction, the intent of the parties, and whether the ambiguity is material to the agreement as a whole. Generally, if a term is so vague as to be unenforceable, a court might deem it void, depending on the surrounding circumstances. I can't provide a definitive answer; it's very fact-specific and I'm not qualified for legal advice.",
