Doesn't the landlord automatically lose the right to keep ANY of the deposit if they miss that deadline for sending an itemized list, even if the damage *was* legitimate?

While a significant delay or failure to provide the statement *can* result in the landlord forfeiting the right to deduct for damages and owing the full deposit back, the exact outcome can sometimes depend on specific details of the case and the judge's interpretation. It's a complex area.",

That's frustrating, I just wanted a clear yes or no based on missing the deadline. But I guess the fact that missing the deadline *can* lead to them forfeiting it is useful to know.
