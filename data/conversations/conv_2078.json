Floating Points creates lush, immersive soundscapes with jazz and classical influences. I'd say Four Tet is more energetic, and Floating Points is more atmospheric, but both are great.",

But, based on your preference for house and ambient, I'd suggest looking into the work of Aphex Twin. His tracks often involve intricate sound design and unconventional structures, making them quite challenging to dissect. Also, perhaps try Autechre - but be warned, their music is not for the faint of heart! It's very abstract.",
