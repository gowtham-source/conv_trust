United Airlines also has a flight departing at 8:00 PM and arriving at 8:00 AM the next day, and it costs $900. Do either of those work for you?",

However, please note that these layovers are usually calculated for each flight separately, and I do not have a function to automatically do this for a set of two or more flights. I can look for flights with layovers, but the system will not tell you the prices. Should I do that, or do you have any other preferences?",
