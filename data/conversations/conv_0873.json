Instead of just listing your responsibilities, try to use action verbs and numbers to demonstrate the impact you made. For example, instead of saying 'Managed social media accounts,' you could say 'Increased social media engagement by 30% within six months through targeted content strategy.'",

Instead of just listing software, you could group them into categories like 'Social Media Management (e.g., Hootsuite, Buffer)' or 'Data Analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Tableau)'. As for the length of the resume, while it depends on experience, strive for one page if you have less than 10 years of experience. If you have 10+ years, two pages is acceptable, but make sure all the content is valuable. The goal is to keep it concise and impactful. Should you have an 'objective' statement at the top?",
