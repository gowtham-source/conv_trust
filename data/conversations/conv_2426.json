A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only inherit from one abstract class.' How does that sound?",

      "utterance": "You're right, that's a more advanced question. Okay, here's a response: 'Race conditions occur when multiple threads try to access and modify the same shared resource concurrently. To handle it, you can use synchronization mechanisms like 'synchronized' blocks or 'locks'. Example: to protect a shared counter, you would use a 'synchronized' block around the increment and decrement operations. This ensures that only one thread can access and modify the counter at a time, preventing inconsistent states.' Does that clarify things for you?",
