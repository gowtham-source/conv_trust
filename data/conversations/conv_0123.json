Ensure that your user account has 'Print' permissions enabled. Let me know if that resolves the issue.",

Have you tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling the printer driver? You can download the latest driver from the manufacturer's website. After downloading, disconnect the printer, run the uninstaller (if one exists, or simply delete the driver through device manager), then install the newly downloaded driver *before* reconnecting the printer.
