Sometimes, store sales or bulk discounts on name-brand items can make them cheaper than the generic option per unit. Also, keep an eye out for manager's specials on items nearing their expiration date \u2013 those can be a steal! I don't have real-time access to prices at your local stores, so it's best to check in-store or online before heading to the checkout.",

A quick, easy, and nutritious meal. 3) Pasta with a simple tomato sauce made from canned tomatoes and seasoned with herbs. Consider adding a can of chickpeas for extra protein.
