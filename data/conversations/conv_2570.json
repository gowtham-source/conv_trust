You typically need the recipient's full name, address, bank name, branch address, account number, and SWIFT/BIC code. Fees vary depending on the currency, destination, and whether it's sent online or in person. Standard fees for online international transfers to Canada are typically around $40-$50, but intermediary banks might add their own charges. You can initiate this process through the 'Transfers' section of your online banking or mobile app, under 'International Wires'.",
