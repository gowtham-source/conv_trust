Also, do you have any preferred colors or styles you're leaning towards? And finally, are you including shoes and accessories in your $200 budget or is that just for the dress/main outfit component?",

These can often be found for under $75. For shoes, consider a versatile pair of heeled sandals or flats, depending on your comfort, in a neutral color (black, nude, or a metallic). These can be found for $50-$75. Accessories are where you can save \u2013 a simple necklace or earrings and a small clutch can be found at affordable retailers like H&M or Forever 21 for around $25-$40 total. This should keep you under budget. Can you give me a good site that aggregates deals on similar outfits? This is more difficult, but I will try.",
