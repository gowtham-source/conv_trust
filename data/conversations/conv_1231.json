I recommend focusing on their specific requirements, using keywords from the job posting, and quantifying your achievements whenever possible. For example, instead of saying \"Developed software\", try \"Developed software that improved system efficiency by 15%.\" Also, ensure your resume format is clean and easy to read. Consider using a format that is easily parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).",

If you do not include these keywords, you may never even be seen by a human reviewer. Sorry, I am unable to suggest any specific tools at this time.",

You can also mention any personal projects or online courses you've taken to demonstrate your willingness to learn and adapt. Be honest about your experience level, but focus on your eagerness to contribute and learn new technologies on the job.
