Considering you enjoy story-rich RPGs and strategy games, I would recommend the following: For RPGs, you might enjoy 'Disco Elysium' \u2013 it's highly praised for its unique setting and narrative. For strategy, how about 'Crusader Kings III'? It offers deep gameplay and allows you to roleplay a medieval dynasty. I'll need a little more information to improve my suggestions though, like your favorite platforms.",

However, 'Pathfinder: Kingmaker' might be a great suggestion; it incorporates city-building elements with traditional RPG mechanics. You manage your kingdom while also exploring a world and fighting enemies. Alternatively, 'Surviving Mars' is a city builder with some RPG elements where you try to build a colony on mars, facing various challenges. The user reviews seem split, but I think it's worth checking out.",
