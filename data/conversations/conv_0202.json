Kingdom Come's narrative is less about grand, world-altering choices and more about the protagonist's personal journey within a specific historical context. Your choices do have consequences, but they tend to be localized and affect your relationships and reputation within the game world rather than dramatically altering the overall plot in the same way as a Bioware title. It prioritizes historical realism and immersion over a traditionally epic, branching narrative.",
