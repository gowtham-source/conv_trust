We use a standard pricing guide to evaluate labor rates and parts costs. If you disagree with the estimate provided by the repair shop and approved by us, you have the option to obtain an independent estimate. We can then review that estimate, however, we are not obligated to cover costs exceeding the fair market value. I'm still on hold with the shop. It seems they are busy at the moment, I will follow up with them again tomorrow.",
