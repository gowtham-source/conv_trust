You might also enjoy 'Horizon Zero Dawn,' while not as intricate narratively, it has a compelling story and a great protagonist. Alternatively, 'Cyberpunk 2077' can also suit your needs.",

There are significant variations in the story depending on your choices, meaning a high degree of replayability. You can have completely different experiences in each playthrough! However, you should be aware of its technical issues.",
