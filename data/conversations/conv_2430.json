Is there anything that somehow combines a really tense psychological thriller with, like, a dash of magical realism? Like, the suspense is grounded, but there's this slightly surreal, unexplained element adding to the dread? That's probably impossible, but I'm curious!",

While I can't pinpoint a book that perfectly blends those three specific components \u2013 tense psychological suspense, a dash of magical realism, and pure dread \u2013 I can suggest titles that touch on similar themes. Perhaps 'Mexican Gothic' by Silvia Moreno-Garcia? It has gothic suspense and uncanny elements.",
