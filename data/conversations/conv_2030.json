It's a classic space opera with some interesting concepts. I'd also recommend 'Revelation Space' by Alastair Reynolds, which is a bit more hard sci-fi, but still features extensive space travel and cool tech. What do you think of these?",

Plus, it has multiple alien species, ancient civilizations, and plenty of action. It is pretty critically acclaimed. I think you'll like it.
