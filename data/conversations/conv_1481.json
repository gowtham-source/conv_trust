      "utterance": "No problem! Briefly, neutral shoes are designed for runners with a neutral stride, meaning their feet land and roll evenly. Stability shoes are designed for runners who overpronate, meaning their feet roll inward excessively. Since you liked the Glycerin, which is a neutral shoe, you likely have a neutral stride. Given your preference and budget, I recommend checking out the Brooks Ghost (a popular neutral option) or the Saucony Kinvara. Both are excellent road running shoes and available in your price range. Would you like me to provide direct links or look for specific sizes?",
