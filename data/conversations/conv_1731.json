Some good choices are: dark brown leather Oxford shoes for a classic look, or for something more stylish, a pair of suede Chelsea boots in a matching color could work well. Also, you might consider some high-quality leather loafers. Do any of those styles appeal to you?",

Burgundy or even a lighter shade of brown can also work, especially if the suit has a subtle pattern. Avoid black loafers; they can sometimes be too formal for semi-formal events unless the suit is a very dark navy. I can provide some specific brand suggestions if you like, but that is outside of my current capabilities, so I'd need some more information from you to do that",
