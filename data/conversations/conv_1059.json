Many users find the Sony WH-1000XM5 to have a slightly richer, more detailed sound profile, while the Bose QuietComfort 45 are often praised for their exceptional comfort and lighter feel. However, comfort is subjective. We recommend reading more user reviews to get a broader range of opinions. Alternatively, many stores offer trial periods where you can return the headphones if they don't meet your expectations.",

      "utterance": "Okay, that's helpful. One last question, and this might be a weird one. I've heard that some noise-canceling headphones can interfere with certain frequencies, like high-pitched noises or even things like airplane engines, creating a weird pressure feeling. Is that a real thing, and if so, which of these two is less likely to do that?",

      "speaker": "agent",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's a valid concern. Some users do experience pressure or a 'sucked-in' feeling with certain noise-canceling headphones due to how they process sound frequencies. It's hard to definitively say which is *less* likely, as individual sensitivity varies. However, the Bose QuietComfort line is often cited as being less prone to this sensation compared to some other brands. Ultimately, trying them on, if possible, would be the best way to determine your personal experience. We also offer a 30-day return policy on all headphones, so you can try them risk-free. Are there any other concerns I can address for you?",
