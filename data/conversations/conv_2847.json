First, turn off the water supply to the faucet, usually under the sink. Then, remove the handle and trim to access the internal components. You'll likely need a screwdriver and possibly an adjustable wrench.",

Ensure the water is completely off. Sometimes, tapping the wrench lightly with a hammer can help vibrate it loose. You could also try a small amount of penetrating oil, being very careful not to get it on visible finishes, though this is less common for faucet repair.",

      "utterance": "Using channel locks might give you a better grip than a standard adjustable wrench, but you run a higher risk of deforming the nut if you apply too much pressure unevenly. A pipe wrench is likely too aggressive and will definitely damage the finish. Given it's a Delta single handle, they use a specific cartridge. Sometimes the correct approach requires a specific tool. Have you checked the faucet model online to see if a specialized Delta tool is recommended for cartridge removal?",

Specialized tools for common faucets like Delta are often relatively inexpensive and can be a worthwhile investment if you plan on doing more DIY. However, if you're uncomfortable or concerned about causing damage, calling a professional plumber is always a safe and reliable option to ensure the repair is done correctly.",
