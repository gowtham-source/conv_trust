Here's some general advice to get you started:\n\n1.  **Teamwork:** Try to form or join a team early. Hackathons are much easier (and more fun!) with others.\n2.  **Idea:** Brainstorm project ideas beforehand.  It's good to have a few options.\n3.  **Resources:** Familiarize yourself with the technologies you might use.\n4.  **Rest:** Remember to take breaks! You'll be more productive if you pace yourself and get some sleep.\n\nAnything else I can help with?",

Judging criteria often vary by hackathon, but typically:\n\n*   **Creativity:** How original and innovative is the project?\n*   **Technical Implementation:** How well-executed is the code? Does it work?\n*   **Impact:** Does the project solve a real problem, and what's its potential reach?\n\nSome hackathons also consider the following:\n*   **Presentation:** How well the team presents and explains the project.\n*   **Use of Technology:** Does the project effectively use the specified technologies?\n\nI recommend checking the specific rules of the hackathon. I can search for the hackathon's website and try to find the details for you. What's the name of the hackathon?",
