However, many players find the core gameplay, which revolves around exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat with a team of characters, to be quite enjoyable. The story is also engaging, and there's a significant amount of content available for free. Whether you find the monetization intrusive is a matter of personal preference, but the base game is certainly fun.",
