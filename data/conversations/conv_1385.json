Additionally, if your performance reviews were consistently positive, the employer's justification for termination might be questionable.

Generally, employers in California do not have an automatic right to access your personal email or phone without your consent, even if they suspect company information is stored there. There are some limited exceptions, such as if they have a court order or a valid warrant, but accessing your personal devices without permission is generally a privacy violation. I strongly recommend consulting with an attorney specializing in employment law to discuss your specific situation and your rights in detail. They can assess your case and advise you further.",
