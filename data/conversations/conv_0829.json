The good news is that your marketing skills, especially the creative aspects, are transferable. Combining that with your passion for fiction writing opens up several possibilities. Have you considered roles like content writing, copywriting for creative agencies, or even technical writing, which often requires a creative approach? We could also explore options related to self-publishing or freelance writing, though these paths require building a strong portfolio and client base.",
