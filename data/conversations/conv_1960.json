Both usually fall within your price range. However, the exact price can fluctuate. To give you the most accurate current recommendations, I would need to know your preferred retailer or location. Also, what if the price of the recommended models goes above the budget due to tax or shipping? How would you like me to address this?",

And if the prices slightly go over my $700 limit due to taxes or a small shipping fee, that's fine. But ideally, keep the before-tax cost under $700. I'm hoping for a good deal overall, I'm starting to get pretty frustrated with my current clunky old laptop! So, what actual models would you suggest, taking Amazon prices into account?",
