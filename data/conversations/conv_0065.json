While the Fullstar is quite durable, several user reviews indicate that it may struggle with very hard vegetables like raw sweet potatoes and butternut squash *without* pre-softening. It works best if you microwave or partially cook those types of vegetables beforehand. For truly hard vegetables, a heavy-duty manual chopper or even a good knife and cutting board would be more effective.",
