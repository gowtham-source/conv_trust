The time allocation depends on the patient's needs, but typically includes a review of medical history, vital signs, a physical exam, and time for the patient to discuss any concerns. If you feel 30 minutes won't be enough, you can discuss it with the doctor directly. If you would like more time, we can try and allocate a longer time block in the future but may need to work with the doctors schedule.
