For durable and comfortable laptop backpacks suitable for commuting and occasional travel, popular options include models from brands like Osprey, Peak Design, and Tortuga. They are known for their robust construction and ergonomic designs. Would you like me to show you some specific products from these brands?",

      "utterance": "Finding a highly durable, waterproof backpack with excellent ergonomics for under $150 can be challenging, as premium materials and construction often increase the price. However, we do have some options that offer good durability and features within that range. Brands like SwissGear, AmazonBasics (for value), and some models from Targus often fit this budget. They may not offer the same level of waterproofing or premium features as the higher-end brands, but they are generally well-regarded for daily commuting. Let me filter some options that fit your criteria and budget. Please wait a moment.",
