Then, we can focus on building your emergency fund further. After that, maximizing your 401k contributions is a good strategy for long-term growth. I can help you calculate the best repayment strategies and contribution rates. I can also provide some resources for debt consolidation if needed. Are you interested in diving deeper on debt repayment first?",

This is called the debt avalanche method. Alternatively, the debt snowball method focuses on paying off the smallest debt first, which can be motivating. You might want to also consider balance transfers, but you have to do your research on them as they're not always the best option. I can help you calculate the interest costs for each approach, and we can see which one is best for your situation.",

We can create a budget to allocate funds to both debt repayment and savings for a down payment, albeit likely at a slower pace on the down payment. I will provide you some options. Let's start by calculating your current income and expenses to determine how much extra money you have available for each goal.
