Another option is 'The Left Hand of Darkness' by Ursula K. Le Guin. It explores gender and societal norms on a fascinating alien world. Have you heard of either of those?",

      "utterance": "'The Left Hand of Darkness' excels in its anthropological approach to world-building. Le Guin doesn't just create a different planet; she explores how language, culture, and even biological sex shape the society and its interactions. The book delves into the consequences of the planet's unique environment and the specific evolutionary path its inhabitants have taken, resulting in a society fundamentally different from our own. It's less about technological advancement and more about societal and psychological differences, making it very thought-provoking. Does that help?",
