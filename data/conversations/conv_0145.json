      "utterance": "That's a fair question! While both filters meet the same rigorous safety standards, the AquaShield Pro's titanium construction offers superior durability and longevity. It's also lighter than comparable filters and resists corrosion far better. The advanced design allows for slightly faster flow rates and easier cleaning in the field, but it's true a significant portion of the cost comes from the premium materials and construction. Customer reviews often highlight its build quality and aesthetic appeal as much as its functionality. I can also show you some customer reviews to help you decide.",
