Ingredients: 1 lb lentils (approx. $2), 1 onion ($1), 2 carrots ($1), 2 celery stalks ($0.75), vegetable broth ($2), canned diced tomatoes ($1). Second, Pasta with tomato sauce: Pasta ($1.50), canned tomato sauce ($2), garlic ($0.50), onion ($1). These two meals should leave you with about $37.25 for the rest of the week. What kind of food do you prefer?",
