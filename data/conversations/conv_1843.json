In that scenario, you have a few options: 1) Try to carefully loosen the valves, but be prepared for a leak. 2) Shut off the water to your whole house at the main water supply. 3) Replace the shut-off valves before starting the faucet installation. I strongly recommend option 3.",

Light surface corrosion on copper pipes is usually not a major issue, but excessive corrosion or signs of leaks could indicate a more serious problem. If you see significant corrosion, or any leaks, it's best to consult with a plumber. But overall, I'm glad I could assist, and good luck with your project!",
