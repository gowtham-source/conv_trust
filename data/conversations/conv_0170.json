Regarding the Oasis Palm option, the listed price includes standard all-inclusive amenities: all meals, snacks, non-alcoholic beverages, and select alcoholic beverages at certain bars and restaurants. Premium drinks, specialty restaurants, and certain activities (like motorized water sports) may incur additional fees. It's always recommended to check the resort's specific policy upon arrival. To give you the most accurate information on potential extra costs, I would recommend visiting the resort's website directly and looking at their all-inclusive details, or checking recent reviews from travelers that mention extra costs.
