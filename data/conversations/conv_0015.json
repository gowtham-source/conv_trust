      "utterance": "While chicken and beef can be incorporated, sticking to a $50 budget requires careful planning. In your zip code, a pound of chicken breast averages around $4-6, and cheaper cuts of beef like ground beef are similar. To make it work, you could consider a smaller portion of meat, about half a pound, used strategically across two meals. For example, you could make chicken stir-fry with lots of vegetables or a ground beef chili with plenty of beans. To stretch the budget further, buy frozen chicken or ground beef, which is often cheaper than fresh, and plan your meals around sales and promotions offered by your local grocery stores. Look for discounted produce, too, as that can vary wildly.",
