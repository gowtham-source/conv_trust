I am a little flexible on the return date, maybe the 28th, but definitely not earlier than the 27th. And, is there any way to guarantee that the prices shown won't change by the time I book?

I've found some options that are close, but unfortunately, I cannot guarantee that the prices won't change. Airline prices fluctuate constantly. The best way to secure a price is to book as soon as you're ready. Regarding a price lock, you might consider a third-party travel agency which sometimes offer a price guarantee, but it's not always available. Would you like me to proceed with searching for flights matching your criteria, or would you like me to look for direct flights only for a different budget?",
