The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a.  We use it to find the values of 'x' that satisfy the equation. Let's work through an example: What is the quadratic formula for the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0?",

The square root of a negative number results in a complex number. This indicates the parabola (the graph of the quadratic equation) doesn't intersect the x-axis. So, in that case, you have complex roots. Would you like me to explain complex numbers and how they relate, or shall we look at some examples?",
