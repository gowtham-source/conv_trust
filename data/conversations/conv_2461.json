While it's difficult to definitively name the *most* innovative, some titles that have tried unique approaches recently include... well, there was one about procedural generation and unique unit types, but the name escapes me at the moment. Perhaps Master of Orion (the reboot) or Age of Wonders series? They mix 4X with tactical combat.",
