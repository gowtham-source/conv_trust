Denial code B9 typically indicates that the patient benefit maximum for this service has been reached. To verify this, you would usually need to check the patient's eligibility and benefits details for the date of service. Do you have access to the payer's portal or eligibility verification system?",

      "utterance": "That is confusing if the portal shows sufficient benefits. While B9 generally means benefit maximum reached, denials can sometimes be applied incorrectly due to processing errors or discrepancies in how benefits are tracked. It's possible there's a different maximum applied based on a different service type or benefit plan detail not immediately obvious in the standard eligibility view. The most effective next step in this specific scenario would be to contact Blue Shield's provider services directly regarding claim 123456789 and denial B9 to request clarification and potentially appeal the denial if your documentation supports the benefit coverage. Be sure to reference the eligibility information you found on their portal.",
