The most fitting example would probably be 'Surviving Mars'. It has strong city-building and resource management components, and it's set on Mars, but the RPG elements are minimal. Also, 'RimWorld' could work, but it's less Sci-Fi focused. Unfortunately, combining all those genres tightly is not very common.",
