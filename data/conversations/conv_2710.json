For troubleshooting, ensure the contacts on both the earbuds and inside the case are clean and free of debris. You can gently wipe them with a dry, soft cloth or a cotton swab. If cleaning doesn't resolve the issue, and given you just received them, it's possible there's a defect. In that case, we would need to proceed with a warranty replacement. Have you tried cleaning the contacts?",
