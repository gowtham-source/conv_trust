Focusing on smart, witty, dialogue-driven comedy, especially with a potential British feel... that narrows it down. Have you seen *In the Loop*? It's a political satire spin-off of a TV show, very quick-witted. Or perhaps *Paddington 2*? While seemingly for kids, it's widely praised for its incredibly charming and clever humor that appeals to adults. *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* is an American film with sharp dialogue and witty banter, though more of a noir-comedy.",
