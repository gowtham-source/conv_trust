Unfortunately, due to API limitations, I am unable to provide live, up-to-the-minute flight prices and availability. I can, however, suggest potential airlines that typically offer direct flights between JFK and LHR, which are British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, and United. The prices vary greatly depending on the specific booking time, day of the week and demand. I suggest checking their websites individually for the most current information. Additionally, would you like me to help you with a search for hotels once you have a flight booked?",
