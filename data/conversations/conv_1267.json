Regarding faucet brands to avoid, that's a challenging question, as it largely depends on personal experiences and specific models. Generally, brands like Moen and Delta are well-regarded, but it's best to read reviews for the specific model you're considering. I'd advise checking consumer reports. Can you tell me about your existing plumbing setup?",

Underneath the sink, I see two water supply lines connected to shut-off valves, and then the faucet's existing supply lines connect to those. Drainage goes into a standard P-trap. Is that enough info?",

      "utterance": "Yes, that's a good start. Before you start, turn off the water supply to both the hot and cold water lines. Then, place a bucket under the P-trap to catch any water that might remain in the pipes. Next, disconnect the water supply lines from the old faucet. Loosen the mounting nuts using the basin wrench, and remove the old faucet. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps?",
