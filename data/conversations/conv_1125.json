These brands often have sales, and you can find gently used items for a fraction of the original price. Another tip is to look for end-of-season clearance racks at stores like Target or Primark if there are any near you. Local thrift stores are also an excellent source for unique and affordable pieces.",

Check clearance sections. For boots try ThredUp or Poshmark to find well-regarded brands gently used.",
