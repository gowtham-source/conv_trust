You will typically connect black to black, white to white, and the green wire on your new fixture to the copper (ground) wire or ground screw on the mounting bracket. However, always turn off the power at the breaker box before starting any electrical work! Make sure to use wire connectors (wire nuts) to secure the connections properly.",

      "utterance": "Ah, that's a good question. In that case, and if the fixture itself is made of non-conductive materials, you might not have a grounding connection on the fixture itself. If your electrical box is metal and you have a grounding wire present, you can attach the fixture's green wire to the grounding screw on the electrical box. Otherwise, ensure a solid connection for the ground wire, even if it involves a pigtail to connect to a grounding point in the box. I recommend, if you are unsure, that you call a qualified electrician as this can be dangerous.",
