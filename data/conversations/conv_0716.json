The Bonavita and OXO models maintain a consistent brewing temperature within the optimal range for coffee extraction, which results in a smoother, less bitter flavor. They also feature pre-infusion cycles to saturate the grounds evenly. Cheaper models often fluctuate in temperature, leading to under- or over-extraction.",

      "utterance": "Coffee makers with built-in grinders can be convenient, but they often compromise on the quality of the grind. A separate burr grinder is generally recommended for the best and most consistent results, as the integrated grinders tend to be blade grinders, which produce unevenly ground coffee. However, if convenience is your top priority, models like the Cuisinart DGB-900BC are decent options.",
