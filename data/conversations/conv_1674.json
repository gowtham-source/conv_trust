Another finished series I can recommend that aligns with your preferences is 'The Realm of the Elderlings' by Robin Hobb. It has dragons, magic, and a compelling plot. It contains multiple sub-series within the main series. Alternatively, 'The Chronicles of Prydain' by Lloyd Alexander is a good option for a shorter, completed series.",

The first trilogy is called 'The Farseer Trilogy', and it begins with 'Assassin's Apprentice'. There is a great deal of backstory in the first series that sets up the rest. Reading out of order would definitely take away from the experience.",
