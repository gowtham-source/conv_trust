This will allow me to identify key skills and keywords to incorporate into your cover letter.

I can help you with structure, content, and even suggest some compelling language to make your application stand out.",

We can break it down into essential and preferred requirements. For 'Experience with cloud platforms,' even if you only have experience with a couple, specify the platforms and highlight any related projects or achievements. For example, if it says \"experience with cloud platforms,\" and you have experience with AWS, you can state it as \"Demonstrated experience with cloud platforms, specifically AWS, used for\u2026 [briefly describe the project and your contributions].\" I am able to generate example bullet points or sections for your cover letter based on the resume and job description.
