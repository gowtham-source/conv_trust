While tracking expenses might seem tedious, it provides the crucial data needed to make informed decisions. Once you have a clear picture of your cash flow, you can start prioritizing. Generally, a foundational step is building a small emergency fund, addressing high-interest debt (like credit cards), and then strategically allocating funds towards your long-term goals (like a house down payment or retirement). The optimal balance depends on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and timelines. Would you like some general frameworks for prioritizing debt repayment versus saving/investing?",
