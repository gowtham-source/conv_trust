      "utterance": "Given that you are in California and have an employment contract, a few key areas of law might be relevant. California is an at-will employment state, but there are exceptions. Your situation could potentially involve a breach of contract claim if the termination violated the terms of your agreement. Additionally, there are laws around discrimination, retaliation, and wrongful termination. To determine which specific laws apply, it would be best to review your contract in detail with a qualified attorney, who can analyze its specific language and circumstances of your termination. For example, there's California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), but if your contract doesn't specify cause for termination, it could be very difficult to prove a wrongful termination case. Is there anything else I can help you with? Or do you have questions on those laws?",
