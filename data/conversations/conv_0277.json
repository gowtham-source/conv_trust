While Chromebooks don't run traditional Windows/Mac applications natively, you can use web-based versions of Microsoft Office (like Office 365) or Google's equivalent (Docs, Sheets, Slides). Many other popular programs also have web versions. However, if you absolutely need to install traditional software, the Acer Aspire 3 would be a better choice, though you might have to compromise on some features within your budget.

Generally, look for a processor with a clock speed of at least 2.0 GHz and 8GB of RAM for a smoother experience. However, SSD storage will also significantly impact loading times compared to a traditional HDD. For noticeable improvement, aim for a CPU benchmark score that is at least 20% higher than what you are used to, available on sites like PassMark. Due to the budget constrains, getting these specs might not be possible but try to get as close as you can!",
