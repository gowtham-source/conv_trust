At that price point, you could potentially find laptops with faster processors (like an Intel Core i5 or a more powerful AMD Ryzen processor) and more RAM (8GB instead of 4GB), leading to a much smoother experience. Some models to consider would be a slightly upgraded Acer Aspire 5 or a lower-end ASUS VivoBook.",
