It's a detective RPG with a unique art style and a heavy focus on narrative and character development. Another option could be 'Cyberpunk 2077', though it has had its share of issues, the world and character customization offer a compelling RPG experience in a futuristic setting.",

      "utterance": "Character progression in 'Kingdom Come: Deliverance' is significantly different from Skyrim. It's skill-based and highly dependent on your actions. So, instead of a traditional leveling system where you just distribute points, your abilities improve by actually doing things. For example, you get better at sword fighting by fighting with a sword, and your speech skill increases by successfully persuading people. This also impacts the story as your reputation can change based on quest outcomes. While there's a main storyline to follow, the game does provide a considerable degree of freedom in exploring the world and tackling quests in various ways, making it less linear than some RPGs, though not as unbound as Skyrim.",
