The soil then draws water up from the reservoir as needed, preventing over or under-watering. This promotes consistent growth and reduces the need for frequent manual watering. As for whether it's worth it, it depends on how often your mom is able to water her plants, and if she struggles with maintaining consistent soil moisture.",
