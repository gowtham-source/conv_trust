      "utterance": "You're right to point that out. Mic quality can be variable. For excellent noise-canceling and clear call quality in that price range, the Bose QuietComfort 45 are fantastic, but they stretch the budget slightly. Alternatively, the Jabra Elite 85h is another good option; they have excellent call quality. But I'm not finding current stock availability online for Jabra. It's likely you'll have to shop in-person for that model.",

      "utterance": "Yes, there can be a noticeable difference. The Bose QC45 generally have a clearer and more natural-sounding microphone for calls, even in noisy environments. The Sony WH-CH720N's microphone is adequate but might pick up more background noise. However, in a quiet setting, the difference may not be that pronounced. Ultimately, sound quality is subjective, and I'd strongly recommend comparing the sound quality yourself. If you have a retail location nearby that sells both, a side-by-side comparison is best.",
