Regarding your question about how the recommendations are generated: Our AI considers a combination of factors, including customer reviews mentioning cushioning and support, expert ratings from running publications, product specifications (like midsole material and heel-to-toe drop), and your specific search terms and stated needs. While we don't currently have knee-impact analysis, we are continuously working on improving our algorithms with more sophisticated data analysis, so that is something we may explore in the future.
