For sci-fi, 'Project Hail Mary' by Andy Weir is a good choice, it's quite accessible. Would you like any more details on those, or perhaps some alternatives?",

Some consider it unique because of its structure and the nature of the problem the protagonist faces. It doesn't really depend on the usual sci-fi tropes. It focuses a lot on problem-solving. I hope that helps.",

      "utterance": "Alright, one common critique is that the science can be a bit hand-wavy at times, though the author does try to keep it grounded. Some readers find the dialogue to be a bit repetitive, and the plot can rely a little too much on exposition. However, it is generally well-received, and most people seem to find it very engaging. I'd suggest checking out some reviews on Goodreads or something to be sure. ",
