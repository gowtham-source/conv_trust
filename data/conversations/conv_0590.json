Here are a few meal ideas based on the ingredients mentioned and within your budget: 1) Lentil Soup: Lentils, carrots, onions, broth (vegetable or chicken bullion to keep it cheap). Add spices for flavor. 2) Oatmeal with fruit: Oats can be topped with in-season fruit or a small amount of nuts/seeds if your budget allows. 3) Brown Rice and Beans: Cook brown rice and beans, add salsa or hot sauce for flavor. You can add some chopped vegetables if available. 4) Egg and veggie scramble: Scramble eggs with the vegetables you have available. I can provide recipes for these if you'd like!",
