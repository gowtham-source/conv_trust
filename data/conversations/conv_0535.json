One strategy would be the debt avalanche method, where you prioritize paying off the card with the highest interest rate first, while making minimum payments on the others.

While it is true that a lower credit score can make it more difficult to qualify for the best interest rates on a personal loan, it's still worth exploring your options. Look into credit unions or online lenders that may offer loans to individuals with less-than-perfect credit. Comparison shopping is key here. Even if the interest rate isn't ideal, it could still be lower than your current credit card rates. Just be sure to read all the terms and conditions carefully before committing to anything.",
