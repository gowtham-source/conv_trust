It's a Viking-themed strategy RPG with beautiful hand-drawn animation and a deeply branching story focused on tough choices. Another option could be 'Age of Wonders: Planetfall', which combines 4X strategy with tactical combat and a sci-fi setting featuring various factions with unique storylines. Does either of those sound interesting?",

I find it frustrating when games force a 'good' or 'bad' morality system on players.",
