      "utterance": "Okay, I understand! For sandals, I suggest looking into leather sandals, preferably in neutral colors like brown, tan, or white. Brands like Birkenstock (Arizona style) or Saltwater Sandals are popular choices. They fit the coastal grandma vibe well and can be styled in multiple ways. However, if I am understanding correctly, you are requesting a list of specific brands. I'll put together a list, but I do need a bit more time. Could you clarify what type of support you're seeking?",

      "utterance": "Certainly! For comfortable yet stylish leather sandals, consider styles like: Fisherman sandals (closed-toe, good for support), slide sandals with a molded footbed (like Birkenstock's), or a simple strappy sandal with a cushioned sole. Look for sandals with good arch support if you plan on doing a lot of walking. Are there any features you specifically want to avoid?",

      "utterance": "That's a good question! For durability and grip in a coastal setting, look for soles made of rubber or a combination of rubber and cork. Rubber provides excellent traction, and cork offers some cushioning. Avoid soles that are entirely made of leather, as they can be slippery when wet. Brands often specify the sole material, so check the product details. I hope that helps, and enjoy your shoe shopping!",
