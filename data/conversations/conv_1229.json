In terms of similar gameplay but a different setting, perhaps consider 'Citizen Sleeper'? It's a sci-fi RPG where you manage a character's stats and relationships in a space station. It still features a strong narrative focus, though, like Disco Elysium, it's not as focused on combat. I hope that helps!",
