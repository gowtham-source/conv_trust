      "utterance": "I understand your frustration. It can be tricky! Let's break it down. Factoring is generally the quickest method *if* the quadratic equation factors easily. Look for two numbers that multiply to give you the 'c' term and add up to the 'b' term in the equation ax² + bx + c = 0. If factoring seems difficult or impossible, then completing the square or the quadratic formula are your next options. Completing the square is useful when 'a' equals 1 and 'b' is an even number, or when you need to rewrite the equation in vertex form. The quadratic formula is your reliable fallback – it *always* works, regardless of the coefficients. Does that clarify things a little?",
