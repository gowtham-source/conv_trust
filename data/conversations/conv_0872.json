Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, ensuring you're adequately hydrated, and taking breaks from screen time can sometimes alleviate tension headaches. Applying a warm compress to your forehead or neck might also provide relief.",

Common culprits include aged cheeses, processed meats containing nitrates/nitrites, chocolate, caffeine (both withdrawal and excess), and alcoholic beverages, especially red wine. It might be helpful to keep a food diary to track what you eat and when your headaches occur to see if you can identify any patterns. I can also search the internet for more information on headache triggers if you would like me to.",
