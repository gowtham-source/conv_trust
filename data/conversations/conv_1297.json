Based on that information, and assuming a moderate investment strategy with an average annual return of 6%, you'll need approximately $1.2 million to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement. To achieve this, you would need to invest approximately $1,000 per month.  It's important to note that this is a simplified calculation, and factors like inflation, taxes, and unexpected expenses are not included.  It's also worth considering other investment vehicles like Roth IRAs to complement your 401k.",

I can adjust the calculations to include inflation and different return scenarios to give you a more accurate picture. As for market volatility, we can explore a more conservative investment strategy with lower, but potentially more stable, returns.
