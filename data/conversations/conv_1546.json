Look for indicators like the type of leather used (full-grain or top-grain are better than split-grain), the stitching (tight and even indicates durability), and the sole construction (stitched or cemented soles are generally more durable than glued). Reading reviews from other buyers can also give you insight. You might also want to research the manufacturer's reputation.",
