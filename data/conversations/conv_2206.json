Rapid prototyping and iteration will be key to success. Also, consider ease of deployment; it shouldn't take more than an hour or two to get your backend live. ",

      "utterance": "Absolutely! Firebase Authentication is quite user-friendly. Here's a simplified process:\n\n1.  **Enable Authentication:** In your Firebase console, enable the authentication providers you want to support (e.g., email/password, Google, Facebook).\n2.  **Install Firebase SDK:** Add the Firebase SDK to your mobile app.\n3.  **Sign Up/Sign In:** Use Firebase's `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` or `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` methods (or the appropriate methods for other providers) in your app.\n4.  **Handle User State:** Listen for authentication state changes using `onAuthStateChanged()`.  This tells you when a user is logged in or out.\n5.  **Secure Your Backend:** Use Firebase's security rules in your database and storage to control access based on user authentication. When making API calls to your database or other backend services, ensure the requests are authenticated. You can use Firebase's SDK or generate custom tokens for this. This is the core of the security. \n\n Good luck at the hackathon!",
