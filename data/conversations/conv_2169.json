For work, perhaps consider some leather sneakers or sleek loafers. Could you tell me more about the type of work you do? That would help me narrow down the options.",

Besides Allbirds and Veja, which have good sustainability practices, brands like Cariuma and Rothy's are also popular and have a variety of styles. However, finding a single brand that perfectly matches all criteria can be difficult. It depends on your specific preferences. I'd recommend researching each brand in more detail to see which aligns best with your priorities. I can also give you a list of sustainable materials if you'd like to filter your search.",
