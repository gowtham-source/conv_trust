Denials for medical necessity can occur if the documentation submitted does not fully support the service billed according to the payer's clinical policies. For CPT 99213, common reasons might include lack of documented history, exam, or medical decision making complexity to justify that level of service for the patient's reported condition.",

To address this payer's specific medical necessity denials for 99213, we recommend reviewing the payer's detailed medical policy for that code. While we don't have a direct pre-submission 'medical necessity' flag linked *specifically* to their subjective criteria, ensuring your documentation clearly supports all elements required for 99213 is key. We can assist with running reports on past denial patterns for that payer to identify trends.",
