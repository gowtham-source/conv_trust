Without the specific modifier used, it's difficult for me to provide exact guidance, but generally, it suggests either the modifier is incorrect for the primary code or a modifier needs to be added. For example, modifier '25' should be included if a significant, separately identifiable Evaluation and Management service is reported on the same day as another procedure. Further, to correct this, you should double-check the documentation to ensure the proper modifier is added. You could consult the CPT code book or contact the insurance provider for clarification.
