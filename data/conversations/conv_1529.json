It's epic fantasy, with a complex magic system and great world-building. Also, have you tried 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' by Scott Lynch? It has a similar feel to 'The Name of the Wind' with a focus on clever characters and intricate plots.",

However, you might enjoy 'Piranesi' by Susanna Clarke, which is an unconventional fantasy with a unique setting. Another is 'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell', also by Clarke, if you enjoyed her other work.",
