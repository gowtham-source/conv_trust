It's essentially a discount the provider has agreed to accept as part of their contract with the insurance company. In your case, the total bill was $1000, and insurance only paid $600. The contractual adjustment was $200. This means the insurance company has negotiated a lower price with the provider. Your patient responsibility of $400 is calculated after this adjustment and the insurance payment. I hope this explains the charges. Let me know if you need further clarification.",
