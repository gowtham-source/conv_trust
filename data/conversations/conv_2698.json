However, many other conditions, some minor and some more serious, can also cause headaches, even without obvious related symptoms. Because symptoms can overlap significantly and vary greatly from person to person, self-diagnosis, especially regarding infections or other internal issues, is complex and potentially inaccurate. A doctor would be able to properly evaluate your specific situation through questions, examination, and possibly tests if needed.",
