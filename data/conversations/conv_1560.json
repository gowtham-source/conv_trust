Then, the Brooks Ghost is known for its comfort and durability. Finally, the Hoka Clifton is popular for its cushioning. Would you like me to provide links to these products?",

For a more tailored recommendation, you can tell me your foot size (including width), pronation type (overpronation, supination, neutral), and preferred running distance/surface. I can then access more specific product data and provide a refined list.  Do you want to give me that information now, or should I just provide links to the shoes I mentioned earlier?",
