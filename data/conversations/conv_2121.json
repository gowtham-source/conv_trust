      "utterance": "Okay, that's a great question. Briefly, microservices are an architectural approach where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service handles a specific business capability and communicates via APIs. Serverless, on the other hand, is a deployment model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Think of microservices as the building blocks, and serverless as a way to manage those building blocks without you having to worry about the underlying server infrastructure. Does that make sense?",

Cons: Increased complexity, distributed debugging, operational overhead. Serverless: Pros: Reduced operational overhead, pay-per-use pricing, automated scaling. Cons: Vendor lock-in, debugging can be tricky, limited execution time and resources.  It is important to provide specific examples based on the company's tech stack, if available. Good luck with your interview!",
