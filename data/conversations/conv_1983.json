For example, a few well-fitting pairs of jeans (around $50-70 each), a selection of plain t-shirts in neutral colors (around $15-20 each), and a lightweight jacket (around $50-70) like a denim jacket or a bomber jacket. You can shop at stores like H&M, Old Navy, or Target for these items. They often have sales. How does that sound?",

For jeans, I'd suggest looking at styles from the brand 'Old Navy' \u2013 their 'High-Waisted Wow' or 'Power Slim' jeans often get good reviews and are frequently on sale for under $60. 'Levi's' has some basic jeans in the $70-80 range which can also be worth the investment, especially if you find a good fit. Check online stores like ASOS and Boohoo too; they often have sales. For t-shirts, I'd say Uniqlo is your best bet for basic, affordable, and durable choices. Good luck!",
