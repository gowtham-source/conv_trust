      "utterance": "That's a great question! 'Edge of Tomorrow' has a similar scale to 'Independence Day' in terms of spectacle, but the tone is quite different. While 'Independence Day' is a more straightforward alien invasion film with a focus on national unity and grand gestures, 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a sci-fi action film with a time-loop mechanic, offering a more unique and often humorous approach to the genre. It's less about a united world and more about personal growth. However, both have a clear 'good vs. evil' narrative. Essentially, If you enjoyed the visual effects and action of Independence Day you will like 'Edge of Tomorrow', but its plot and character development is much stronger.",
