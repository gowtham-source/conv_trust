This is fairly standard practice with many payers. For Patient 67890... it appears the 36415 (routine venipuncture) is being bundled into 99203 as well. However, sometimes payers incorrectly bundle services. Can you confirm that the venipuncture was *medically necessary* and distinctly separate from the E/M service? If so, we can appeal.",
