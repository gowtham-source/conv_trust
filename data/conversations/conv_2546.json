While some thermostats have a small backup battery for settings, they typically require consistent power from the HVAC system to operate the screen and main functions. A complete blank screen often indicates a power interruption to the thermostat itself. Could you please try carefully removing the thermostat from the baseplate and then reattaching it? This can sometimes help reset the connection.",

      "utterance": "I understand your concern, especially with it being a relatively new device. Since reconnecting it didn't restore power, and you've confirmed the breaker is on, there might be an issue with the wiring connection on the baseplate or potentially the thermostat unit itself. Further troubleshooting would require checking the low-voltage wiring behind the thermostat, which can be complex. For safety and a thorough assessment, I recommend contacting a qualified HVAC technician or our customer support for advanced diagnostics or potential warranty options.",
