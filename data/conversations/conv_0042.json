While its noise canceling isn't *quite* as robust as the other two, its microphone clarity is consistently praised, and it often goes on sale for around $170. A less common option but highly respected for mics is the EPOS Sennheiser ADAPT 260, though this may require checking several retailers to find it near your price point. Do either of those sound appealing?",
