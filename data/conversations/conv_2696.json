Feeling 'blah' and a lack of purpose are strong indicators that it might be time to explore new directions. A good first step is often to reflect on your skills, interests, and values. Have you thought about what aspects of marketing you *do* enjoy, or what other activities outside of work bring you energy?",

      "utterance": "That's a very insightful question. Translating interests and skills into viable career paths can indeed feel abstract. It's not always a direct one-to-one mapping. Instead of looking for a job title that *is* painting or hiking, consider the *transferable skills* you use and the *values* those activities fulfill. For example, painting involves creativity, attention to detail, and perhaps project completion. Hiking might involve planning, problem-solving, and perseverance. Identifying these underlying skills and values is key to finding roles where you can apply them, even if the industry is different.",

Useful resources include LinkedIn (looking at profiles of people in those roles), industry-specific websites and associations, and informational interviews (reaching out to people working in those fields for brief chats).
