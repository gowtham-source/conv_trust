Based on your interest in RPGs, here are a few popular and well-regarded titles:\n\n*   **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt:** A vast open-world RPG with a compelling story and rich characters.\n*   **Divinity: Original Sin 2:** A highly praised CRPG with deep gameplay and strategic combat.\n*   **Elden Ring:** From Software's open-world RPG with challenging combat and a mysterious world.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these or suggest other genres?",

Diablo IV has a more streamlined experience, a stronger narrative focus, and is generally considered more accessible. Path of Exile is known for its complex skill trees and intricate crafting systems, which might be why you disliked it. If you didn't like Path of Exile due to its complexity, Diablo IV would likely be a better fit.",
