Both have built-in microphones. Here's a quick comparison:\n\n*   **Sony WH-CH720N:** Superior comfort, great battery life (up to 35 hours), good sound quality, and a built-in microphone for calls.\n*   **Anker Soundcore Life Q30:** Excellent noise cancellation for the price, good sound quality, decent battery life (around 40 hours), and also includes a microphone.\n\nI hope this helps with making a selection.",
