While I can't guarantee that any particular brand is entirely free of these issues, looking for certifications like Fair Trade or organic cotton can provide some assurance. Choosing to buy fewer items of higher quality that will last longer can also be a more sustainable approach. Is there anything else I can help you with in regards to finding clothes within your budget?",
