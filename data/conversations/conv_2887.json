Based on their current listings and typical offerings, both meet the price criteria and list free Wi-Fi as a standard amenity. The hostel would likely be the cheapest, but the hotel offers private rooms.",

While generally considered a busy urban neighborhood, like many city centers, it's advisable to be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. It's close to public transport and some attractions. It's not typically highlighted as a 'sketchy' area compared to some other city districts. Would you like me to check options in a different part of Seattle that might be known for being quieter or perceived as safer?",
