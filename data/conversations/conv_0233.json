Websites like Devpost, Hackathon.io, and Major League Hacking (MLH) list upcoming events. Consider the themes, technologies, and prizes offered to find one that aligns with your skills and interests. Do any of those themes catch your eye in particular?",

Focus on a project that you can realistically complete within the timeframe, and don't be afraid to learn new things along the way. Many hackathons also have workshops and mentors to help you. I would also suggest researching some APIs that you can integrate into your project beforehand.",

Dedicate a portion of the hackathon (e.g., the first few hours) to exploring a new technology relevant to your project. Then, switch to using your existing skills to build the core functionality. If you get stuck, revisit the new technology or ask for help. Prioritize a working prototype over a perfectly polished project that uses all the latest tech. Aim for a minimum viable product (MVP) first, then add features if time allows. Focus on demonstrable progress.",
