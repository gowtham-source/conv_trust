At your age and income, a good first step is to maximize any employer-sponsored retirement plans, especially if they offer matching contributions. Do you have a 401(k) or similar plan at work? If so, what is the matching policy?",

Receiving a 50% return on your contributions is often a better deal than avoiding interest on student loans, unless the interest rate on your loans is exceptionally high (e.g., above 7%). Contributing enough to get the full employer match is essentially free money. After you secure the match, consider a strategy that balances debt repayment and further retirement savings. As a general rule, it's advisable to save 15% of your income for retirement to meet your retirement goals.",
