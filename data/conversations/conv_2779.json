I'm seeing a ton of denials with code PR-24 ('Payment adjusted because submitted charges are inconsistent with the billing guidelines').

While the claims may appear similar, inconsistencies can arise from various factors, such as updates to payer policies that went into effect recently, specific nuances in the patient's plan on the service date, or even subtle differences in how modifiers or units were applied. Without reviewing the detailed remittance advice and claim submission data for those specific dates of service, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for the change in payment behavior. I can, however, help you group these PR-24 denials by date or patient to look for patterns, or draft template appeals based on common reasons for this code.",
