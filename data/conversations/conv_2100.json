Based on your preferences for RPGs with deep storylines and character customization, I recommend checking out the following:\n\n*   **Divinity: Original Sin 2:** A highly acclaimed RPG with an incredible story, vast world, and extensive character customization options.\n*   **Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous:** A complex and engaging RPG with a strong emphasis on choices and consequences.\n*   **Cyberpunk 2077:** A sci-fi RPG with deep customization, though its launch was rocky, it's improved. \n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these, or perhaps suggest some other genres you may like?",

The general consensus is that it's in a much better state now, with performance and stability significantly improved. However, I can't definitively say it will be perfect for *you*, as experiences vary. It still has some bugs, but the core experience and story are good. If you're looking for a similar vibe but less risk, perhaps consider other recommendations. I can try again.",
