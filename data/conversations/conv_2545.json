Regarding baggage, policies can vary depending on the specific fare class purchased. Generally, basic economy may not include a free checked bag, but standard economy often does. For the most precise information regarding baggage allowances and fees for that exact fare, I strongly recommend checking American Airlines' official website or the fare rules before booking.",
