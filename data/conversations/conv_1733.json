The tracking information indicates it was picked up by the carrier on Tuesday. However, the tracking link on your email appears to be incorrect. I will submit this to our technical team. In the meantime, if you follow these steps, you can track your order manually. You should also get a new tracking email in the next few hours. I'm so sorry for this inconvenience. But you can still track your order manually. The problem is related to a recent update to the shipping system, and we are working to address it. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?",
