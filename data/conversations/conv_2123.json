You'll need to disconnect the water supply line (make sure to turn off the water first!), then carefully remove the ice maker unit. After that, you should be able to clear the line with a thin, flexible wire. However, before you start, I must warn you: any tampering with the appliance could invalidate the warranty, so you should follow the steps to the letter and make sure you are careful. Alternatively, you can contact our technicians to get assistance. Would you like me to set up a service call for you?",
