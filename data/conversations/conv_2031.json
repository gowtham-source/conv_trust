Both are well-regarded for their noise cancellation capabilities and usually fall within your price range. Would you like me to provide links to those products?",

      "utterance": "That's a valid concern! While the Q30 offers good value, you're right, the noise cancellation isn't top-tier. To get significantly better noise cancellation, you might need to stretch your budget. The Bose QuietComfort 45 is often considered the gold standard, but it's usually closer to the $300 range. A potentially suitable alternative, and one that often has sales, is the Jabra Elite 85h. They sometimes go on sale and come in around $180, but I can't guarantee the exact price at this moment. I will note, however, that it's possible those aren't available in all regions.",
