      "utterance": "Feeling a sense of numbness can certainly make it challenging to connect with potential interests. Sometimes, starting with very small steps can help. Instead of thinking about a whole new career, maybe try exploring low-commitment activities or reading about various industries just to see if anything sparks even a tiny bit of curiosity. Regarding the fear of picking the wrong path or financial concerns, many people explore options through informational interviews, online courses, or even part-time volunteer work in a new field *before* committing fully. It helps test the waters and gather real-world insight. We could look into some introductory resources or simple self-assessment tools if you like.",
