The guide says run `npm install` in the root directory, but it's throwing a ton of 'peer dependency' errors and then failing with 'ENOENT: no such file or directory'. It's really frustrating, I just want to start coding!",

The 'ENOENT: no such file or directory' error during `npm install` often indicates that either the package.json file is missing from the directory you are in, or there's an issue with file permissions or a missing file required by one of the dependencies. Could you please confirm you are running the command in the correct root directory of the project that contains the package.json file? You can use `ls` or `dir` to check.",

That error strongly suggests a file system issue or a problem with a dependency that's trying to access a non-existent file or directory during installation. Have you tried clearing the npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`) and then running `npm install` again? Sometimes a corrupted cache can cause strange installation problems. Also, ensure your user has the necessary read/write permissions for the project directory.",
