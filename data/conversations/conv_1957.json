Based on your preference for action with a strong narrative and your enjoyment of Mission: Impossible, I recommend the following: *The Bourne Identity* (2002), *Mad Max: Fury Road* (2015), and *Edge of Tomorrow* (2014).

It\u2019s a great choice if you like the spy-thriller elements of the Mission: Impossible films. It also spawned several sequels.

Hmmm... considering your preference for spy thrillers with action, but excluding the Bourne franchise, I would recommend *Atomic Blonde* (2017) and *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* (2011). They both feature strong female and male leads respectively, and solid, intriguing plots.  Do either of those appeal?",
