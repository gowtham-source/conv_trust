My database is limited in that specific area, but you might enjoy 'Coherence' (2013) even though it's slightly before your preferred date range. While not time travel in the strictest sense, it deals with alternate realities and complex cause-and-effect relationships in a similar mind-bending way. Alternatively, I recommend doing a targeted search on movie forums dedicated to independent science fiction films for more obscure recommendations. Sorry I couldn't be of more specific assistance!",
