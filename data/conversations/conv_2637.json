Consider staples like rice, pasta, oats, beans, lentils, eggs, and inexpensive vegetables like potatoes, carrots, onions, and cabbage. Look for sales on protein sources like chicken thighs or ground meat, or use canned tuna. You can make many different meals by combining these basics.",

      "utterance": "That's a very valid concern! Variety comes from preparation and seasoning. For example, eggs can be scrambled, fried, boiled, or used in a frittata with leftover vegetables. Rice and beans can be the base for a 'burrito bowl' with added salsa, or made into a soup, or even spiced differently for Indian or Mexican flavors. Using affordable spices and sauces (like soy sauce, hot sauce, affordable seasonings) makes a huge difference. You can also make larger batches of staple carbs or proteins and then use them differently throughout the week, like roasted chicken one night, and chicken salad for lunch the next day. Buying frozen vegetables can also offer variety without spoilage.",
