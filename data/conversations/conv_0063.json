      "utterance": "Yes, some studies suggest that artificial sweeteners, particularly aspartame, can trigger headaches in susceptible individuals. Determining if it's the cause can be challenging. One approach is to eliminate artificial sweeteners from your diet for a period of time (e.g., 2-4 weeks) and carefully monitor if your headaches decrease in frequency or intensity. Be sure to read food labels diligently, as artificial sweeteners are often hidden in processed foods and beverages. However, given the persistence of your headaches, I strongly recommend consulting with a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.",
