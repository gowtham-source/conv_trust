The cheapest direct flight is with British Airways, departing from JFK at 8:00 PM on October 28th and arriving at Heathrow at 8:00 AM the next day. The round trip ticket is $750. There's also a connecting flight via Icelandair for $600, but that has a 5-hour layover. Do either of these sound suitable?",

As for the pros and cons of the direct flight: Pros: less travel time, less stress. Cons: more expensive and less time for layovers. The connecting flight is more affordable but has the layover.
