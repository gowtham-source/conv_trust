However, I did notice that for CPT code 99214 to Blue Cross, the contracted rate we have on file is $135. For 73560 to United Healthcare, the contracted rate is $75, and for 29505 to Blue Cross, it's $55. It seems your office is billing above the contracted rates for those specific services. Are you perhaps using an outdated fee schedule in your billing system?",
