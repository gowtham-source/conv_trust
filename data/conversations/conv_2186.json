Okay, an abstract class can have method implementations while an interface can not (until recent versions of Java). An interface defines a contract, while an abstract class can provide some default implementations. I'd use an interface when I want to define a capability that many unrelated classes can implement, whereas an abstract class makes sense for when you have a common base behavior that can be extended.
