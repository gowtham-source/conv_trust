They don't have active noise cancelling, but have good passive noise isolation.\n3. **Beats Solo3 Wireless**: A popular brand with strong bass, usually in the price range.\n\nWould you like to know more about any of these?",

However, the Sony headphones have better noise cancellation and may offer a better overall experience for those who prioritize that feature. In terms of features, the Sony headphones do have some extras like touch controls which the Audio-Technica ones may lack. Unfortunately, I can not provide you with a detailed comparison matrix comparing the two. But from a general perspective, the ATH-M20xBT provides better sound and the Sony provides more features.",
