Some smaller brands specialize in vegan footwear with a more classic aesthetic, like Wills Vegan Shoes or Brave GentleMan, but they might be slightly above your budget. Alternatively, you could consider looking for high-quality faux leather oxfords or loafers from more mainstream brands and prioritizing craftsmanship.",
