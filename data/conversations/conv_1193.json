With a Psychology degree, you have a wide range of options. We can explore roles in social work, human resources, market research, counseling (with further education), and more. To help me narrow down the possibilities, what aspects of your psychology studies did you find most engaging, and what are your key skills or interests outside of your formal education?",

Considering your interest in research and data analysis, along with a desire to help people, have you considered roles in user experience (UX) research or market research? These fields often value psychology backgrounds because of your understanding of human behavior. While experience is definitely valued, many companies also offer internships or junior roles to help develop talent. We can look at strategies for highlighting relevant skills from your academic projects and volunteer work to make your application stand out. Also, it's worth considering informational interviews to learn about different career paths.",
