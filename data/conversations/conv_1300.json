Firstly, consider focusing on paying down the higher-interest debt, potentially the student loans, while still contributing a bit to retirement to take advantage of compounding. We can discuss strategies like debt snowball or debt avalanche. Would you like to explore these options?",

Spreading your investments across different asset classes can help mitigate risk. As for your immediate cash flow, have you created a detailed budget? If not, that's a critical first step, as understanding your spending habits will help you identify areas where you can save money to allocate to both debt repayment and retirement. It will require some more information from your end, but I can generate a budget template if you'd like, or offer options for budgeting apps.",
