As for gaming, realistically, running modern AAA titles smoothly at low settings on an $800 laptop will be challenging. You might be able to play some older titles or less demanding indie games, but for newer games, you'd likely experience low frame rates and reduced graphical fidelity. If gaming is a priority, you might need to consider increasing your budget or looking at dedicated gaming laptops, even if they are entry-level.",
