Frequent headaches can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, eye strain, or even something as simple as a change in sleep patterns. To give you more specific advice, could you tell me more about the type of headaches you're experiencing? Are they throbbing, sharp, or constant? Where is the pain located?",

While stress can certainly be a contributing factor to tension headaches, throbbing pain, especially around the temples and behind the eyes, could also indicate a migraine. I am not qualified to make a diagnosis, but these details are relevant to your symptoms. Given the frequency and severity, I strongly recommend consulting with a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional. They can properly assess your symptoms, rule out any underlying medical conditions, and recommend appropriate treatment options.",

What type of headaches do you think I'm experiencing (tension, migraine, etc.) based on my symptoms? 3. What are the potential treatment options for my headaches, and what are the pros and cons of each? 4. Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to help prevent headaches? 5. When should I seek emergency medical care for a headache? Asking these questions will help you and your doctor create the right care plan.",
