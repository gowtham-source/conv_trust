      "utterance": "That's a good question! Determining the exact lifespan can be tricky, as it depends heavily on the runner's weight, running style, and the surfaces they run on. However, generally, both the Hoka Clifton and Brooks Glycerin have similar lifespans, around 300-500 miles. The Brooks Glycerin is made from higher-quality materials, so might outlast the Hoka, especially if the runner is heavier. I am sorry that I can't provide more precise data, my data sources are limited.",
