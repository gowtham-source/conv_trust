However, generally, both the Hoka Clifton and Brooks Glycerin have similar lifespans, around 300-500 miles. The Brooks Glycerin is made from higher-quality materials, so might outlast the Hoka, especially if the runner is heavier. I am sorry that I can't provide more precise data, my data sources are limited.",
