It often includes details that can significantly impact the liability assessment, such as official measurements, diagrams, and potentially witness interviews conducted by the police that differ from what you provided. Until we have that, we cannot finalize the investigation and authorize any payments. I understand the delay is inconvenient, and I will add a note to the claim to expedite the process as much as possible. I will follow up with you in 3 business days with an update.",
