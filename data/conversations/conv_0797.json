While *Into the Breach* is more gameplay-focused, *Crusader Kings III* is known for generating emergent narratives based on the actions of your characters and the complex web of relationships between them. You essentially write your own epic story. Alternatively, *The Banner Saga* is a turn-based strategy game with a beautifully crafted, albeit grim, narrative and stunning visuals. I hope one of these is what you are looking for!",
