First, I recommend finding a hackathon that aligns with your interests and skill level. Websites like Devpost and Eventbrite list many hackathons. Once you find one, carefully review the rules, themes, and judging criteria. This will help you brainstorm relevant project ideas. Any particular area of interest you have (e.g., web development, AI, mobile apps)?",

Instead of 'build an AI that solves everything', try 'build an AI that classifies different species of flowers using images'. Does this give you a better idea? What other questions do you have?",
