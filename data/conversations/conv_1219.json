For deployment, cloud-based solutions like Google Cloud or AWS offer services that simplify the process. However, based on your questions, it appears the waste management project might be too ambitious for a hackathon timeline. Perhaps the personalized learning platform is a better fit, given your skillset? If you tell me what parts you have experience with, I can help you refine the implementation.",

Then, use machine learning (likely a classification model) on data such as time spent on concepts, the types of content accessed (e.g. video, text), and quiz scores to start to determine a user's learning style. The tricky part will be finding appropriate data and training the AI model effectively within the timeframe. Keep in mind the hackathon goals and scope.",
