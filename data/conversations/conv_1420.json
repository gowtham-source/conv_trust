The writing is excellent, making it worth the read. The core gameplay is very unconventional, but it is still considered an RPG. It is hard to give a good explanation of the gameplay. Have you enjoyed other unconventional RPGs before? Maybe I can provide an analogy or two. Do you have any other questions? ",
