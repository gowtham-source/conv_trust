Ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone are common choices, each with varying costs and installation requirements. Once you decide on a tile, you'll need to measure the square footage of the bathroom to determine how much tile to purchase. Remember to add about 10% extra for cuts and breakage.",

Be sure to wear safety glasses, gloves, and a dust mask. Work in small sections, and try to get under the tile to break the bond with the subfloor. Avoid damaging the subfloor as much as possible; repairs will add to your project time and expense.",

      "utterance": "Addressing an uneven subfloor is crucial for a successful tile installation. The best approach depends on the extent of the unevenness. For minor imperfections (less than 1/4 inch), a self-leveling compound can be applied. For larger discrepancies, you may need to use a leveling mortar or even consider adding a layer of cement board. It's important to accurately assess the level of the floor using a level and straight edge. If the unevenness is significant, you may want to consult with a professional to ensure the subfloor is adequately prepared. Using a self-leveling compound typically involves pouring the mixture and spreading it with a gauge rake or trowel, following the manufacturer's instructions carefully.",
