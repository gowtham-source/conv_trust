How about a classic blazer (around $75), a pair of well-fitting, neutral-colored pants (around $60), a couple of nice tops that can mix and match (around $30 each), and a pair of comfortable, yet stylish flats or low heels (around $105)? This leaves a little wiggle room for accessories if needed. Does that sound good?",

For pants, consider shopping at stores with good return policies so you can try things on at home. As for the budget, it is a recommendation and may vary depending on your location and shopping habits. For example, consider thrifting for higher-quality items at a discounted price. As for fit, a tailor can do minor adjustments. Would you like me to help you find some specific items online or provide links to stores near you?",
