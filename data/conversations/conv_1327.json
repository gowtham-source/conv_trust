      "utterance": "Hello! I can certainly help with that. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics. Basically, it states that the distribution of the sample means approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's distribution, *given a sufficiently large sample size*. Do you want me to elaborate on any part of that, or would you like an example?",

      "utterance": "Okay. Let's say we have a large population of people and we measure their heights. The distribution of heights in the population is likely not perfectly normal. However, if you take many samples of, say, 30 people each and calculate the *average* height for each sample, the distribution of those sample averages will tend to be a normal distribution. Does that make sense?",

      "utterance": "Exactly! Even with skewed data, the CLT still applies, *provided your sample size is large enough*. The larger the sample size, the better the approximation to a normal distribution. Skewness will still have some effect on the distribution of means for smaller sample sizes, but it becomes less significant as the sample size increases. For heavily skewed distributions, you might need a larger sample size (e.g., n>30) to see the effects of CLT. Would you like me to generate a visualisation of this?",

The distribution of the averages of multiple dice rolls will approximate a normal distribution. The more dice rolls you average together, the closer the distribution of the averages will be to a normal distribution. Try simulating that yourself!
