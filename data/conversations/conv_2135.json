Their most popular items include the Spicy Tofu Bowl and the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl (though that has meat). As for healthiness, it depends on your choices. You can easily make a healthy bowl by selecting a whole grain base, lean protein, and lots of veggies. I'd recommend focusing on the options with a lot of fresh vegetables.

However, based on typical menu offerings and general health principles, I would recommend building your own bowl: Start with a quinoa or brown rice base, add a generous portion of steamed or roasted vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers), choose a plant-based protein (tofu or edamame), and opt for a light dressing on the side, such as a lemon vinaigrette. This allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes to maximize health benefits.",
