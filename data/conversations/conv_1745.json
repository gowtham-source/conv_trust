Second, try wiggling the bracket slightly while screwing it in. Sometimes the threads just need a little encouragement. If that doesn't work, try a different screw, or washers to give you more bite. And make sure the box can handle the fan weight. Does your box have a weight rating on it?",

      "utterance": "That's a very good question. If the fan is too heavy for the existing box, you'll need to replace the box with one rated for ceiling fans. These boxes are specifically designed to support the weight. The replacement process will involve cutting a larger hole in the ceiling, removing the old box and wiring, and then installing the new box. This often involves some structural reinforcement to the ceiling joist. Safety first! If you are unsure on that task, consider consulting an electrician for the box replacement.",
