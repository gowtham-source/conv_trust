Overuse of pain relievers can sometimes lead to rebound headaches as well. It's difficult to diagnose the cause without a medical examination. However, if your headache is accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or neurological symptoms, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. If those are absent, I suggest keeping a headache diary to record frequency, intensity, and any triggers you can identify. Also, try adjusting your posture and workstation setup. For a more concrete diagnosis, a visit to your primary care physician is recommended.",
