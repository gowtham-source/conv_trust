As for overnight shipping on a replacement, I can't guarantee it at this stage, but I will add a note to the order. If the shoes are confirmed lost, we typically offer a full refund or a replacement shipped with expedited service at no extra cost to you. I'll update you within 24 hours regarding the carrier's investigation. Is there anything else I can help you with at the moment?",
