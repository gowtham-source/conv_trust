Based on your needs and budget, here are two specific recommendations with links (prices may vary depending on the retailer): \n\n1.  **Acer Aspire 5 (A515-56-51W3):** Often found around $600-$700. [Link to example retailer - will not be a real link, as this response is text only, but imagine a link here]. It typically has an Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD. \n2.  **HP Pavilion 15-eg0000 series:** These can sometimes be found for under $800, but prices fluctuate. [Link to example retailer - again, just imagine this is a real link]. Check for models with an Intel Core i5 or better. \n\n  These models are good for work and have reasonable battery life. Please double-check the specifications before purchasing to ensure they meet your needs. Do either of those models appeal to you?",

Make sure to carefully review the condition description and warranty details before buying.
