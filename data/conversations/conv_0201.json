'Grand strategy' usually implies games with a very broad scope, involving management of an entire nation, empire, or large organization over extended periods. They often feature complex systems for diplomacy, economics, military campaigns, and internal politics. Examples would be the 'Civilization' or 'Crusader Kings' series. The level of control and long term planning are key differentiators. Does that clarify things?",
