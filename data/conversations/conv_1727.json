      "utterance": "That's a reasonable question. 'Unforeseen circumstances' often refers to the legal concept of 'force majeure.' This typically covers events outside of a party's control that make contract performance impossible or impractical. The vendor would need to prove the event, such as a natural disaster or government regulation, directly caused the delay and prevented them from fulfilling their obligations. It's tricky, and they will need to back this up with evidence. Do you have evidence that contradicts their claims?",

This should clearly outline the breach of contract, the evidence you have, and the specific remedy you are seeking (i.e., the penalty payment).

However, consider the following: attorney fees, court filing fees, potential for expert witness fees, and other litigation costs. The complexity of the case and the amount in dispute will greatly influence this. It would be best to get a consultation with a local attorney to obtain a more accurate estimate and discuss the specific risks and rewards of pursuing the case.",
