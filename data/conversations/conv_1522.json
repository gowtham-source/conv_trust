An eigenvector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that does not change direction when that linear transformation is applied to it. The eigenvalue is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled. Does that make sense so far?",

So, the eigenvalue associated with v is 3. We can verify this using the equation Av = \u03bbv, where A is the matrix, v is the eigenvector, and \u03bb is the eigenvalue. In this case, [[2, 1], [1, 2]] * [1, 1] = 3 * [1, 1]. Got it?",

To find the eigenvalues, you solve the characteristic equation, which is det(A - \u03bbI) = 0, where A is your matrix, \u03bb is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix. Then, for each eigenvalue you find, you substitute it back into the equation (A - \u03bbI)v = 0, and solve for the eigenvector v.  It involves determinants and solving systems of linear equations. Can you give me a matrix and I can show you the steps?",
