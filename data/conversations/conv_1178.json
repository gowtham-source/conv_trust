This could include the cost to complete the unfinished work, any costs you incurred due to the delay, and potentially even consequential damages if they were foreseeable. The worst-case scenario is that a court finds that no material breach occurred, or that your damages are less than you claim. This is often difficult to determine without a full investigation and can be affected by many factors. It's important to note that legal outcomes are not guaranteed.",
