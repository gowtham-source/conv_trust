This could include the cost to complete the unfinished work, any costs you incurred due to the delay, and potentially even consequential damages if they were foreseeable. The worst-case scenario is that a court finds that no material breach occurred, or that your damages are less than you claim. This is often difficult to determine without a full investigation and can be affected by many factors. It's important to note that legal outcomes are not guaranteed.",

Generally, it refers to events that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into, and which made performance impossible or commercially impracticable. Common examples include natural disasters or significant regulatory changes. They have to prove it made fulfilling the contract impossible. I would need to review the specific details of the contract and their explanation to give a definitive answer.",
