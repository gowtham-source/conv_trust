      "utterance": "I understand your frustration. Generally, the liability for damage caused by a fallen tree depends on whether the owner of the tree was negligent. If the tree was healthy and the fall was truly due to an unpredictable natural event, like an unusually strong storm, it might indeed be considered an 'act of God,' and your neighbor may not be liable. However, if the tree was diseased, rotting, or otherwise posed a known hazard, and your neighbor failed to take reasonable steps to maintain it, he could be held responsible. Do you have any evidence suggesting the tree was unhealthy before it fell?",

      "utterance": "You're right, proving negligence can be challenging. If you were to sue, the typical process would involve filing a complaint with the court, serving your neighbor with the lawsuit, engaging in discovery (exchanging information and documents), and potentially going to trial. Mediation is also often attempted before trial. As for cost, it's highly variable depending on the complexity of the case, attorney's fees (which can be hourly or contingent on winning), court filing fees, and expert witness fees if you need a tree expert to testify. A rough estimate could range from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. It's best to consult with a local attorney to get a more precise estimate based on the specific details of your situation. Keep in mind that you'd also have to weigh these potential costs against the cost of the fence repair itself. I can provide a list of lawyers in your area specializing in property disputes if you'd like. Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?",
