While I don't have access to the exact methodology of the recommendation engine, I can attempt to find alternatives. Based on your request for similar features and price, I can suggest the KEEN Targhee III Mid Waterproof hiking boots. They often receive positive feedback on their longevity. In addition to your prior purchases, the system may be using factors like browsing history and customer reviews to generate the suggestions, so there is a degree of estimation involved. Would you like me to explore further options or provide a comparison between the two boots I've mentioned?",
