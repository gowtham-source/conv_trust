Think classic pieces like a neutral-colored t-shirt, a good pair of jeans or chinos (depending on your style), and a simple sweater. Sales and thrifting will be your best friends.

Pay attention to the construction – look for shoes with stitched soles rather than glued ones. Another option is to prioritize one good pair of versatile shoes like sneakers or boots and care for them meticulously to extend their lifespan. Unfortunately, it’s hard to guarantee finding brand-new, high-quality footwear at that price point consistently.",
