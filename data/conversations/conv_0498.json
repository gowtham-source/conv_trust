We can also automate claim submission and tracking, freeing up your staff's time. Finally, we can provide real-time analytics on your billing performance, helping you identify areas for improvement. I predict a 20% reduction in claim denials within the first three months. Please note these are just predictions and actual results may vary.",

It can also identify potential coding issues and suggest appropriate modifiers. However, for claims requiring extensive medical necessity documentation or appeals, manual review is still generally necessary. The AI assists by organizing information and suggesting potential arguments, but it does not replace human expertise entirely. It would greatly speed up the process though.",
