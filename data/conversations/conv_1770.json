Those who enjoy complex symbolism and a slow-burn narrative tend to love it. Those seeking immediate action may get frustrated. Perhaps consider reading a detailed plot summary first and seeing if the premise grabs you. Unfortunately, predicting enjoyment is not a perfect science.",

It's less about flashy spells and more about political maneuvering and manipulation of trade and economics as a form of magic. Alternatively, \"The First Law\" trilogy by Joe Abercrombie has a more gritty and realistic approach to magic, though it's not the primary focus. I hope those options are useful!",
