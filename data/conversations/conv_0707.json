      "utterance": "I understand! Choosing a paint color can definitely be overwhelming. To narrow it down, let's consider a few factors. First, what direction does your living room face? This affects the natural light. North-facing rooms tend to be cooler, so a warmer grey might be preferable. South-facing rooms get warmer light, so a cooler grey could work well. Also, what kind of furniture and decor do you have? We want a grey that complements your existing style. Finally, do you have any specific undertones you want to avoid? Some greys can lean blue, green, or even purple.",

      "utterance": "Based on the information you provided, focusing on greys with warm or neutral undertones should work well. Considering your east-facing room and neutral furniture, a light, slightly warm grey would likely create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. As for the cost of painting, that varies greatly depending on the size of your room, the painter's rates, and the quality of paint you choose. I don't have access to real-time pricing data for local contractors, but I can give you a general range. For a standard-sized living room, professional painting might cost anywhere from $300 to $800, possibly more. Doing it yourself will only cost the price of the paint and supplies, but it will require your time and effort, of course.",

Is it *really* worth it to splurge on the expensive stuff? What am I actually getting for the extra money? Hopefully something other than just a fancy label.",
