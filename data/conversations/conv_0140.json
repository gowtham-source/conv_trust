Please allow 24-48 hours for the deposit to clear after the initiation. As for your question regarding FDIC insurance, the standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. This means that if you have multiple accounts in different ownership categories (e.g., individual, joint), each is insured up to $250,000. You can find more information and resources at FDIC.gov. I can also provide a more detailed analysis of your specific accounts and coverage if you wish.",
