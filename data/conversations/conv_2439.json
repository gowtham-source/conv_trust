While a benefit check can give a general indication, final coverage is always determined based on the submitted claim details and medical necessity review against the plan's specific policy language. The denial might stem from a specific exclusion in the policy documentation that wasn't fully articulated during the benefit check, or the medical necessity criteria weren't met *per Cigna's specific guidelines*. To appeal this, you'll need to review Cigna's clinical policy for code 98765, compare it against your documentation, and potentially include a copy of the benefit verification notes if they contradict the denial. I can help you find the relevant Cigna policy if you provide the patient's exact plan name or group number.",
