For late 60s/early 70s blues-rock with a heavier edge, consider bands such as Blue Cheer, Grand Funk Railroad, or perhaps even early Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green.

Here's a tricky one though: Can you recommend a band that manages to blend the complex arrangements of 70s progressive rock (like Yes or Genesis) with the raw energy and lyrical style of 90s grunge (like Pearl Jam or Nirvana)? Is there even such a thing?",

While not a direct match, some bands have touched upon elements of both. You might explore bands like Tool, who combine heavy, complex instrumentation with emotional vocals, or perhaps Porcupine Tree, who evolved from psychedelic rock into more progressive territory with a modern edge, though less 'grunge' directly.
