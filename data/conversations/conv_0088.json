It's difficult to say specifically why the charge is what it is without further investigation into the details of your visit and your insurance coverage. However, factors contributing to the charge can include the time spent with the provider, the extent of the examination, and the complexity of the medical decision-making involved. I would recommend contacting ABC Medical Group's billing department directly. They can provide a detailed explanation of the charges and how they align with your insurance coverage. Would you like me to help you find their contact information?",
