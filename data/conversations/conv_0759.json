Regarding your question about carbon footprint, unfortunately, I am not equipped to accurately estimate carbon emissions for specific flight routes at this time. However, generally, flights with layovers tend to have a higher carbon footprint due to the extra takeoff and landing. I recommend using a dedicated carbon footprint calculator for flight estimations. Are you interested in booking either of the previously mentioned flights?",
