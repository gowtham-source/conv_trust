It generally falls within that price range and offers a good balance of performance and features for everyday use. Another option is the Acer Aspire 5.

These often dip below $700, and even the older models offer significantly better performance and battery life than most new laptops in the sub-$600 range. Alternatively, you could wait for sales events like Black Friday; laptops tend to see pretty significant discounts then. How does that sound?",
