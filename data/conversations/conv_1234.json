For the leadership question, you can highlight instances where you've mentored junior engineers, led project initiatives, or taken ownership of critical components. Use action verbs and quantify your impact whenever possible. For example, instead of saying 'Led a team to develop...', try 'Led a team of 5 engineers to develop X, resulting in Y'. I'll provide a revised resume draft shortly. It might take a few minutes to adjust everything to Google's standards. I will also include some tips on what to expect in your interview process.",
