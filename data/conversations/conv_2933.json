While there isn't one single 'magic formula' that works for everyone, a widely accepted approach is to prioritize building a small emergency fund first, then aggressively tackling high-interest debt (like most credit cards), and finally focusing on broader savings and investing goals. The 'best' order can depend on your specific debt interest rates and your comfort level with risk.",
