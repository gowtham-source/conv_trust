It specifies the company, your account details, and sometimes the payment frequency. Legally, it grants the company permission but also provides you with rights under schemes like the Direct Debit Guarantee (in applicable regions), which allows you to receive a full refund if an incorrect amount is taken or if it's taken on the wrong date. You can also cancel a mandate at any time through your bank. It serves as your proof of permission and your protection mechanism.",
