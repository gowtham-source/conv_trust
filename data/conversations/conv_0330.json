A good option that leans more into the horror genre but has great mystery elements and co-op is 'The Dark Pictures Anthology' series, specifically 'Man of Medan' or 'Little Hope'. They're cinematic, have branching narratives, and are designed for cooperative play where players make choices that influence the story together. While not strictly detective games, they offer similar investigative gameplay. Let me know what you think!",
