It explores similar themes of societal decay and features a detective investigating a series of bizarre murders. Be warned, it is pretty unsettling. Another possibility, although tonally different, is 'The Skin I Live In'. It's a Pedro Almod\u00f3var film, so more stylish and less gritty than 'Se7en', but still deals with dark subject matter and has significant twists.",
