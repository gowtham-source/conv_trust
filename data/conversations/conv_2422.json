Regarding why it was rejected, even if the modifier was included, it's possible it wasn't formatted correctly, or the payer's system flagged it as invalid. I would recommend double-checking the claim form for any typos and contacting the payer directly for clarification, as they can provide the most specific feedback on the reason. I know it can be cumbersome, but it's the best approach.",
