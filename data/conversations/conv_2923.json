However, it's also important to contribute enough to your retirement plan, especially if your employer offers a match, as that's free money. A balanced approach often involves focusing on high-interest debt while contributing at least enough to get the full employer match on retirement savings.",

Choosing specific investments involves understanding concepts like diversification, asset allocation, and your personal comfort level with risk. While paying off debt is crucial, especially high-interest debt, starting to invest early can benefit from compounding. For detailed investment advice and help tailoring a strategy specifically to your circumstances, consulting with a qualified financial advisor is highly recommended.",
