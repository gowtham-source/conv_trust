Whether you save depends on your decisions based on that information. If your spending is not the main problem, we could consider evaluating your debt repayment strategy, looking at ways to improve your income, or reviewing your investment options (although given your debt and savings, we'd focus on those first). We can discuss debt consolidation, negotiating with your student loan provider, or exploring side hustle opportunities. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options?",
