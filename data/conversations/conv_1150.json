Some common options include archivist, historian (often requiring further education), museum curator, librarian, and teacher. However, the research and analytical skills you developed are transferable to fields like journalism, law, policy analysis, and even business roles like market research. Which of these areas sound potentially interesting to you, even a little?",

Your history degree provides a strong foundation in research, critical thinking, and writing, all of which are valuable in journalism. To enhance your competitiveness, consider building a portfolio by writing for student publications, starting a blog, or freelancing. Look for internships at local newspapers or online news outlets. Would you like me to help you identify some resources for finding entry-level journalism positions or internship opportunities that might value a history background?",
