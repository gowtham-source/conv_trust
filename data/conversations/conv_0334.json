Loafers offer a classic and versatile option, while ankle boots can add a touch of edginess. Both can be found with comfortable soles and heels under 2 inches. Would you like me to provide some specific brand or style examples?",

      "utterance": "That's a valid concern! For all-day comfort in ankle boots, look for soft, supple leather or suede uppers that will mold to your feet. A cushioned insole, preferably with arch support, is crucial. Also, pay attention to the sole; a rubber or crepe sole will provide better shock absorption than a leather sole. Consider trying boots with a wider toe box to prevent pinching. Brands like Ecco, Clarks, and Naturalizer are known for comfort-focused designs. Reading online reviews focusing on comfort can also be very insightful.",
