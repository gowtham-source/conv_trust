Based on a $75 budget for two people for a week, here's a potential grocery list:\n\n*   **Protein:** Eggs (dozen), Dried Beans, Canned Tuna, Chicken Thighs\n*   **Produce:** Onions, Potatoes, Carrots, Apples, Bananas, Spinach\n*   **Grains/Carbs:** Rice, Pasta, Bread\n*   **Other:** Peanut Butter, Oatmeal\n\nThis should provide you with a good base. The prices will vary depending on your location and store. To make this budget work, consider buying in bulk when it makes sense and planning meals around the most affordable items.

      "utterance": "Okay, I understand. Including ground beef or salmon is challenging but not impossible. To fit it within your budget, it will require some compromises. You could substitute one or two meals per week with a ground beef or salmon dish and compensate by purchasing less of other protein options. I would recommend buying frozen salmon fillets, as fresh salmon is more expensive. The remaining items on the list are still affordable to maintain a low food cost. To maximize value, consider portion sizes, shop around for sales, and look for cheaper cuts of meat when possible. Here\u2019s an example incorporating ground beef for two meals. This can provide variety to your diet within your budget. \n\n*   **Protein:** Eggs (dozen), Ground Beef (1lb), Dried Beans, Canned Tuna, Chicken Thighs (1lb)\n*   **Produce:** Onions, Potatoes, Carrots, Apples, Bananas, Spinach\n*   **Grains/Carbs:** Rice, Pasta, Bread\n*   **Other:** Peanut Butter, Oatmeal\n\nIt may be helpful to check prices at your local stores to make sure this plan works.
