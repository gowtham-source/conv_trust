Okay, searching for hotels near the Magnificent Mile, with a pool, from Friday to Sunday next weekend, budget under $300 per night. I've found a few options. One is the Thompson Hotel, which seems to fit the criteria. However, the price is slightly above your budget at $320 per night. Another is the Hampton Inn, it has a pool and falls within your budget. Would you like me to look at other options?",
