They often have good deals on jeans (aim for one good pair, around $25-$30), basic t-shirts ($5-$10 each), and affordable sweaters ($15-$25). You can also look for sales and clearance items to stretch your budget further.",

      "utterance": "That's a valid concern. Sustainable and ethical fashion within a $100 budget is definitely challenging but not impossible. Consider thrifting or shopping at consignment stores \u2013 you can often find high-quality, pre-owned items for a fraction of the original price. Look for local charity shops or online platforms like ThredUp or Poshmark. Prioritize buying fewer, well-made pieces that will last longer. For example, a well-made second-hand pair of jeans might be better than two pairs of cheaply made new ones. Also, consider eco-friendly brands like Pact or tentree, which occasionally have sales, or look for items made with organic cotton, which is more sustainable.",
