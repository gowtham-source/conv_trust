To check baggage fees, I can try to find the details for the specific flights I found earlier. This information can be a bit tricky to pinpoint since it's airline-specific and sometimes hidden. Let me see what I can find... Okay, it looks like checking a bag on Spirit could cost around $65 each way. For the $450 flights, baggage fees vary, but it's best to check the specific airline's website before booking. I'm still learning to pull that information reliably, I apologize.",
