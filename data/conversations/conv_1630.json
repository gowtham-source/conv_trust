For Chelsea boots under $200, I'd recommend looking at brands like Thursday Boot Company (they sometimes have sales), or checking out online retailers that offer their own private label brands. Also, look for sales at department stores and consider boots made of synthetic leather to save money. Make sure to read reviews carefully!",

Also, be mindful of the construction; glued soles are often less durable than those that are stitched. Full-grain leather is typically the best for lasting quality, but can be more expensive.
