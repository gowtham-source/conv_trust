Unfortunately, the standard tracking information doesn't always specify the exact reason for a delay or the precise location during transit. Delays can sometimes occur due to high volume, weather, or unforeseen operational issues. Based on the lack of recent scans, it's possible there was a sorting issue or a temporary hold-up at a facility. I can open an investigation with the carrier on your behalf to try and get a more specific update or push for movement.",
