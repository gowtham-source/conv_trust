Regarding reliability, generally, Breville is a great brand, but some users report occasional issues after a couple of years. Gaggia and Rancilio are known for their robust build, though require a bit more manual skill. But comparing reliability is challenging because of differing user experiences; some of the cheaper models may have a shorter lifespan.",

The Rancilio Silvia, while highly reliable, requires a separate grinder and more manual control, which can be a steeper learning curve.
