For hiking boots suitable for difficult terrain, I would recommend exploring these categories:\n\n*   **Brands**: Salomon, Merrell, Lowa, and Scarpa are well-regarded for their durability and performance. \n*   **Features**: Look for boots with a waterproof membrane (like Gore-Tex), good ankle support, and a sturdy sole with aggressive tread for grip. \n\nI suggest filtering our site by those criteria to find the boots that best fit your needs and budget.
