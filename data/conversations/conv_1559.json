Consider these potential extra costs:\n*   **Condiments:** Mayonnaise, ketchup, dressings, and sauces can add up.\n*   **Spices:** While I included a small amount for spices, buying new ones (especially if you lack a good selection) can increase your costs.\n*   **Snacks:** Snacks are often overlooked. Think about if you buy them, then calculate the cost.\n*   **Beverages:** Tea, coffee, juices. These things can be expensive and easy to miss from your budget.\n*   **Impulse Buys:** These items are probably the biggest budget buster, so think about this as you shop! \n\nI'll try to include these in the next grocery list I give you.
