While you can't install the desktop versions of Microsoft Office directly on a Chromebook, you can use the web-based versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

You might find a slightly older but more powerful laptop for around the same price. Look for brands like Dell or HP on reputable refurbished sites. Always check the warranty and return policy before purchasing a refurbished item. Good luck with your laptop hunt!",
