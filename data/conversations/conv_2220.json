Here's a strategy: \n\n1.  **Be Honest, but Concise:** In a cover letter or a resume's summary section, you can briefly explain the gap. For example, \"Career break to focus on family responsibilities.\" Avoid providing extensive personal details. \n2.  **Focus on Skills:** Highlight how your skills remain relevant. Frame your responsibilities as being similar to project management (e.g., managing household budgets, scheduling, and conflict resolution). \n3.  **Emphasize Professional Development:** If you used the time to take courses, volunteer, or upskill, be sure to list that on your resume. This demonstrates your continued interest and engagement in your field. If the interviewer asks about the gap, frame it as a choice to take care of a family matter and focus on your preparedness to rejoin the workforce. Let me know if that's helpful. ",
