By running style, I mean things like your foot strike (do you land on your heel, midfoot, or toes?), and whether you need extra support for pronation or supination. For now, I can recommend some popular road running shoes.  How about the Adidas Ultraboost, the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 3, or the Hoka Clifton 9?  These are generally well-regarded.",

The Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 3 is known for its super soft cushioning and is great for long runs. The Hoka Clifton 9 is known for its balance of cushioning and lightweight design. They are all road shoes.  For a more detailed comparison, I recommend checking out reviews on running websites like Runner's World, or check your local running store for them to try them out.",

I can't give you a definitive answer about the availability *right now* without knowing your location and desired retailer, but I'd suggest you search for 'Hoka Clifton 9 wide' on your favorite shopping sites like Amazon or REI. Regarding return policies, that depends on the retailer. Most major retailers offer returns within 30 days, but check the specific retailer's website for their exact policy.",

Based on your 5-10 miles, a few times a week on road, and assuming average conditions, I would *estimate* they might last you between 300-500 miles. However, keep an eye out for signs of wear, such as compressed cushioning or worn-down outsoles, as those are better indicators. Consider using a running log to track your mileage!",
