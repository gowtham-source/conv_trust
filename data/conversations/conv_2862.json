Ensure you highlight keywords like 'marketing strategy,' 'data analysis,' and potentially 'creative campaigns.' Your formatting is clean overall. Now, regarding your cover letter for Innovate Solutions, I can help draft one highlighting your relevant skills and enthusiasm for creativity and data.

Instead of just listing skills, describe *how* you used creativity or data analysis in a specific project. Research Innovate Solutions' values and mission \u2013 weaving in language that resonates with their culture can also make it feel more personal and targeted.

Instead of saying 'I used data analysis and was creative,' you could say something like: 'Leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, I identified a previously unseen customer segment, which inspired a highly creative campaign that resulted in a 15% increase in engagement.' This connects the skill (data analysis) with a specific action (identified segment), a personal contribution (inspired campaign), and a measurable result, using relevant keywords ('creative,' potentially implying 'innovative solutions').",
