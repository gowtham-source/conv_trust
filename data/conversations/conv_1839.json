Try checking out the album 'How Blue Can You Get' by Buddy Guy, as it features collaborations across multiple genres. Also, consider the work of artists like R.L. Burnside, who incorporated elements of punk. Finally, there are a lot of artists using blues as a base for fusion, incorporating genres like electronic music. I could compile some more options for you if you'd like, but some more info on what you're looking for would also help! ",
