I'd recommend checking out *Atomic Blonde* (female lead, action), *The Raid: Redemption* (Indonesian martial arts film - very intense), and *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (beautifully shot martial arts epic). I am still under development and sometimes my recommendations can be hit or miss, so hopefully you will find something you like in those suggestions.",
