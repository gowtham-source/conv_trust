They offer a timeless silhouette but can be found with interesting details like unique stitching or a slightly chunkier sole for an edgier feel. Another option is a pair of leather loafers with a modern twist, maybe with a metallic detail or a slightly squared toe. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?",

      "utterance": "That's a fair point! Not all loafers are created equal. When I say 'edgy,' I'm referring to loafers that incorporate unexpected details. Think thicker, lug soles (like on some boots), metallic hardware (chains, buckles), or unconventional materials like textured leather or even incorporating elements of a sneaker design. These details elevate the loafer beyond the traditional, preppy look. If you're still hesitant, we can explore other options. How about trying a sleek pair of leather sneakers? Many brands offer premium leather sneakers with minimalist designs that can be dressed up or down.",
