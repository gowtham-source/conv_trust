I recommend practicing coding problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. Focus on common algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph traversal. Also, spend time reviewing time and space complexity. I can provide some example problems if you'd like.",

      "utterance": "That's a very complex problem! A multi-layered approach would be needed. First, we'd need robust AI models trained to identify potentially misleading content based on various features like source credibility, linguistic patterns, and image analysis. Second, a system for user reporting and review by human moderators. Third, partnerships with fact-checking organizations to verify claims. Fourth, implementing algorithms to limit the reach of suspicious content and display warning labels. It would be an ongoing arms race, but those are some initial considerations.",
