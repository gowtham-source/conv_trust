First, we multiply the coefficient of x² (which is 3) by the constant term (-6), which gives us -18. Then we look for factors of -18 that add up to 7. These are 9 and -2... (the response was cut off for brevity). ...Then you rewrite the middle term, and factor by grouping. This will give you the solutions.",
