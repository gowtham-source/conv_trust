Then, take a picture of the wiring in the existing fixture and the wires coming out of the ceiling, and send it to me. Also, what kind of new fixture are you installing?",

The picture probably isn't very good, I have terrible lighting in the hallway. Also, there are like, four wires from the ceiling? And only two from the new fixture. This is more complicated than I thought!",

      "utterance": "Okay, I see the picture. Based on the image, it looks like you have a white wire (neutral), a black wire (hot), and a ground wire (likely green or bare copper) from the ceiling. The fourth wire may be a second hot wire for a switch or another circuit. The LED fixture should have a white and black wire. The white from the fixture connects to the white from the ceiling (neutral), the black from the fixture connects to the black from the ceiling (hot). Connect the ground wires together as well. Now, the trickier part: what do I do with the other hot wire, if it exists? It's not always easy to tell based on a picture, but sometimes it's a completely separate circuit. Do you have a multimeter to check for voltage? If not, it might be best to call an electrician, as there are some safety considerations I can't really advise on here.",
