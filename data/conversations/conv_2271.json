However, pricing strategies vary greatly depending on the airline, the route, and market conditions. While waiting *might* get you a better deal, there's also a risk that prices could go up. Based on my current search, I'm finding some direct flights with prices ranging from $700 to $900, depending on the specific dates. Some indirect flights are cheaper, around $500-600. What do you think about the general prices?",
