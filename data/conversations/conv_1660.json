It's the first book in *The Gentleman Bastards* series and features clever characters, intricate plotting, and a unique world. It's not quite as massive as *Stormlight*, but the focus is on character development and a compelling story. Do you want to know more?",

Magic is rare and based on summoning from a different realm, but the rules and limitations are what make it so unique. It's a slower-paced book, but the magic system is intricate and unlike anything else. I hope you enjoy it!",
