While they target a similar market, the Acer Nitro 5 often has slightly more aggressive styling and frequently offers configurations with higher refresh rate displays, which is a plus for fast-paced gaming. The HP Victus 15 tends to have a more understated look suitable for work, and configurations can vary widely, sometimes focusing more on balanced performance rather than peak gaming specs.",
