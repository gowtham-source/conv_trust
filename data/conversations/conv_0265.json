While I can't disclose the specific algorithms used, I can tell you that the 'mind-bending' categorization is based on a combination of factors, including user reviews mentioning terms like 'thought-provoking,' 'complex plot,' and 'unpredictable,' as well as the film's narrative complexity score derived from its plot synopsis and critical analyses. It's not a perfect system, but it's designed to identify films that challenge conventional storytelling.",
