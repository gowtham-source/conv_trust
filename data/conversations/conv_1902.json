I can suggest artists like Led Zeppelin, who blend rock with blues, or maybe some bands like Mumford & Sons who lean into folk influences, though they do sometimes cross into the pop spectrum.

For math rock, try 'Battles' or 'toe'. They have instrumentals with complex rhythms and song structures. Give them a listen and let me know what you think!",
