This document includes *all* your work history, skills, projects, and achievements in detail. Then, for each application, you create a *new* version by selecting and editing content from your master that is most relevant to that specific job description. Your contact information and basic education details can usually remain consistent. However, your summary or objective statement, specific bullet points under experience, and your list of skills should be carefully tailored using keywords from the job posting.",
