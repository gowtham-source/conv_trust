Even with documentation, payers sometimes have requirements for prior authorization, step therapy protocols (trying other treatments first), or specific diagnostic criteria that weren't met according to their internal review. While your documentation might be sufficient from a clinical perspective, it might not have aligned with the payer's exact administrative or coverage rules for that specific code and diagnosis. It's complex, and sometimes challenging to navigate their varying requirements.",
