Third-party sites sometimes offer better deals due to bulk purchasing power or special agreements, but it's always wise to compare prices across multiple sources, including the hotel's official website, to ensure you're getting the best rate. Often, booking directly with the hotel allows for more flexibility and potentially access to loyalty program benefits or direct negotiation. I can check for available discounts for AAA or senior rates at the Nikko if you wish.",
