I recommend you rewrite your project descriptions to specifically mention the cloud platforms you've used (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and quantify your leadership experience. For example, instead of saying 'Led development team', try 'Led a team of 5 developers in the implementation of...resulting in...'. Also, consider adding a 'Skills' section at the beginning to highlight the most relevant technologies. Now, for the challenging question, I'd say this is good so far.",
