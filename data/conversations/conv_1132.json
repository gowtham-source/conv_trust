Consider checking secondhand stores and online marketplaces like ThredUp or Poshmark. You might find a gently used, higher-quality dress from an ethical brand at a discounted price. Alternatively, you could invest in one key ethical piece, like a dress from a brand that uses sustainable materials, and pair it with more affordable accessories from mainstream retailers. This can spread the cost and support ethical practices where possible. You could also look at brands that offer clothing rental services. Is this helpful?",
