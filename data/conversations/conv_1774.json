Okay, consider these factors when comparing project ideas: 1. **Your existing skill set:** Which stack are you most comfortable with? 2. **Time constraints:** How long do you have to build each? 3. **Scope and Complexity:** What features are you planning to include? 4. **Learning curve:** How steep is the learning curve for each technology? 5. **Available Resources**: Are there good tutorials or documentation for the WebAssembly project?  Try to outline the minimum viable product (MVP) for each idea. That'll help you narrow it down and get a clearer comparison. Good luck!",
