For comfort, look for shoes with cushioned insoles, good arch support, and breathable materials. Checking reviews for mentions of comfort is also a good strategy.",

For brands known for blending style and comfort in the smart casual category, consider looking at options from Cole Haan (especially their Zer\u00f8grand line), Ecco, Clarks (some of their more modern styles), or Vionic, which focuses heavily on arch support and cushioning while offering increasingly stylish designs. Specific styles like supportive loafers, platform oxfords, or ankle boots with comfort technology could work well.",

      "utterance": "Genuine leather, especially soft lambskin or calfskin, tends to mold to your foot over time, often improving comfort. Suede can also be quite comfortable if it's a good quality, soft material, but it's less durable in wet conditions and doesn't stretch quite as much as smooth leather. For longevity and often better structure that aids comfort, quality leather is a solid choice for smart casual footwear.",
