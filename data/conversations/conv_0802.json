Regarding IP protection, generally, you retain the rights to what you create during the hackathon unless explicitly stated otherwise in the hackathon's rules. Read the fine print carefully before registering! Some hackathons might have clauses about licensing your code for their use (usually non-commercial). If you create something you think is valuable, consider documenting your process and code meticulously. Timestamping your work can also help. However, for official legal advice, you should consult with an attorney specializing in intellectual property law.",
