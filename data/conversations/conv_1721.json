      "utterance": "That's a great question. Our recommendations are based on a combination of factors, including user reviews, expert reviews, and specifications provided by the manufacturers. We analyze data regarding cushioning, stability, and fit. However, predicting real-world durability is tricky, as it depends on running style, frequency, and surface. While we aim to incorporate durability data, specific wear patterns are not always predictable. I've adjusted my previous suggestions to include more durable options; try looking at the Saucony Kinvara 14 or the ASICS GEL-Kayano 30 instead. Both are also available at or near your price point.",
