Based on your preferences for over-ear, noise-canceling headphones under $200, I recommend these options: [Product A: $179], [Product B: $199], and [Product C: $160].  Product A has good reviews. Product B is the newest. Product C is highly rated for comfort. However, it's hard to say which is best for you without knowing your specific use case, so can you tell me what you intend to use the headphones for? Would this be for travel, listening at home, or something else?",
