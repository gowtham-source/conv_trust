The Hyatt Regency typically has a slightly higher price point. The view at the Swiss\u00f4tel is probably more reliable as it faces directly towards the lake. As for the balcony, I am unable to ascertain which rooms have that amenity, I would recommend checking the specifics of the hotel rooms you like on a hotel's website.",
