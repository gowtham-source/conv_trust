While I cannot disclose the destination account number directly in this chat for security reasons, I can tell you whether the transfer was to an internal account you own, or to an external account. I can also see if it was a scheduled transfer. Based on the transaction details for November 20th, this $350 transfer was indeed sent to an external account you have previously linked. You can view the last few digits of the destination account and institution name by logging into your online banking portal and reviewing the detailed transaction history for that specific entry. If you still don't recognize it or suspect unauthorized activity, you can contact our fraud department immediately.",
