However, focusing on materials like soft leather or cushioned soles can help with comfort. For elevation and style, look for unique details like interesting hardware, subtle platforms, or unexpected colorways in classic shapes like a low-profile trainer or a pointed-toe flat. Brands often have different comfort technologies, so reading reviews specific to walking is key.",
