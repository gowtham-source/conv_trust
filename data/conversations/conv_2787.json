      "utterance": "Thank you for providing the model number and light status. A blinking orange 'i' light often indicates an error state or a problem with the Wi-Fi connection or setup process. While a jammed print head is a possibility, the combination of the Wi-Fi light being off and the blinking 'i' suggests a connection issue is more likely. Since you've already tried a power cycle, let's try initiating a Wi-Fi setup reset on the printer itself. This usually involves holding down a specific button combination. Do you have the printer manual handy, or would you like me to look up the steps for that model?",
