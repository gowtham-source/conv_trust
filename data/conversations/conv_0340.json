While the lines can be blurry, psychological thrillers generally focus on the mental and emotional states of the characters, building suspense through their perceptions, anxieties, and inner conflicts, rather than relying solely on action or external threats. They often explore themes like manipulation, paranoia, and identity. 'Regular' thrillers, while still suspenseful, tend to prioritize plot-driven action and external dangers.",
