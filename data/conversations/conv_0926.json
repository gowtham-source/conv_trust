To provide the best possible advice, I need a little more information. Are you experiencing any other symptoms like fever, sore throat, chest pain, shortness of breath, or loss of taste or smell?

While home oxygen saturation monitors can provide a general indication of your oxygen levels, they are not always completely accurate and should not replace a professional medical evaluation. I recommend scheduling an appointment with your doctor or visiting a walk-in clinic as soon as possible to get checked out. They can perform the necessary tests to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the appropriate treatment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?",
