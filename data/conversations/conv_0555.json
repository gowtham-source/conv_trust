While direct experience is always a plus, many companies value transferable skills like research, analysis, and communication, which you developed during your history studies. We can work on tailoring your resume and cover letter to highlight these skills and demonstrate their relevance to market research or competitive intelligence roles. We can also explore internship opportunities or entry-level positions that specifically look for candidates with strong research abilities, regardless of their specific academic background.",
