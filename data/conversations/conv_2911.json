Finding that exact combination with 'less mainstream' is challenging. Let me search again... A title that might fit, although it leans slightly more into action, is GreedFall. It's a fantasy setting (unique colonial fantasy), PC, action combat, has story/choice elements, and some customization. It's not as massive as a AAA title, and often considered slightly less mainstream than The Witcher or Elden Ring.",
