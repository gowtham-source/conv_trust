You could probably find a basic t-shirt for around $10-15, jeans or chinos for $20-30, and a simple jacket or cardigan for another $20-30. Accessorize with some inexpensive jewelry from Amazon or even a thrift store find to complete the look without breaking the bank.",

      "utterance": "That's a very valid concern. While SHEIN often offers incredibly low prices, their ethical and environmental practices are indeed questionable. For budget-friendly and more ethical options, consider thrifting or buying secondhand from stores like Goodwill or online platforms like ThredUp and Poshmark. You can often find high-quality items for a fraction of their original price. Also, keep an eye out for sales and clearance sections at more sustainable brands, even if it requires a bit more patience. Sometimes you can get lucky!",
