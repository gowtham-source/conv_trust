Define the single most important feature (the 'Minimum Viable Product' or MVP) and build only that. Avoid adding non-essential features early on. Think about what's unique or interesting about your idea and build just enough to showcase that concept effectively within the time limit. Good luck!",

We want to build something with live traffic data, but most public APIs have strict rate limits or require complex authentication we don't have time for. It's frustrating, we have a cool idea but feel blocked by data access. Are there any clever ways to get access to real-time, high-volume data during a hackathon without hitting these common roadblocks?",

      "utterance": "I understand your frustration; relying on live, specific data is critical for your concept. Experienced teams often prepare data strategies beforehand. For hackathons specifically, some strategies might include: looking for data aggregators that *might* offer temporary developer access (though rare for high-volume live feeds), exploring data marketplaces that could have trial access, or focusing the project scope slightly to use open, less restricted datasets that proxy the concept (e.g., using historical data or a more limited, but free, API to *demonstrate* the idea's logic, and stating in your pitch that live data would be integrated post-hackathon). Direct scraping is generally unreliable and against terms of service for many sources, making it risky for a time-boxed event. Focusing on demonstrating the *logic* with available data, rather than requiring full live coverage, is often the most pragmatic approach under pressure.",
