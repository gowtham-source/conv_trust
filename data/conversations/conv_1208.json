The Acer Aspire 5 is a solid choice for writing and browsing, and it usually falls within that price range. The Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is another popular option. Both have good battery life and comfortable keyboards. Would you like me to provide links to their product pages or perhaps compare their specs side-by-side?",

While it's impossible to predict the future with complete accuracy, generally, a laptop in that price range, used primarily for writing and browsing, should remain functional for at least 3-5 years with proper care. The lifespan also depends on software updates and the evolving demands of websites and applications. Let me pull up a comparison of the core specs, focusing on processor, RAM, and storage, which are the key factors influencing longevity for your use case. The Acer Aspire 5 typically comes with an AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD, while the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 often has similar specs, though sometimes with a slightly less powerful processor variant. Both are upgradable to 16GB of RAM which could extend their usability a bit further. Is this information helpful?",
