      "utterance": "That's a great question! Compatibility depends on the number of holes in your sink and the connections. Since you mentioned a sprayer, you likely have a sink with 3 or 4 holes. The new faucet will either fit directly, or you might need an escutcheon plate (a decorative cover) to fill any unused holes. Unfortunately, I am unable to definitively determine if they are compatible based on the picture alone. You would need to measure the distance between the holes on your sink and compare them with the dimensions of your new faucet. Would you like me to give some instructions on how to measure your sink?",
