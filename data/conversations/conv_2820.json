While there's no single 'secret method,' successful teams often rely on structured brainstorming techniques, focusing on solving a specific problem, or iterating rapidly on initial concepts. Drawing on diverse team skills and experiences can also help spark different perspectives. Sometimes, the most feasible ideas come from simplifying a grander vision.",
