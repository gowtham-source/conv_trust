To prepare, I recommend you first identify your goals for the event, review the hackathon's theme or focus areas if available, and maybe brush up on a technology stack you're comfortable with or want to explore.

While there's no single 'secret method,' successful teams often rely on structured brainstorming techniques, focusing on solving a specific problem, or iterating rapidly on initial concepts. Drawing on diverse team skills and experiences can also help spark different perspectives. Sometimes, the most feasible ideas come from simplifying a grander vision.",
