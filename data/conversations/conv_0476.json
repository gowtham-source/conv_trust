I have removed the add-on and issued a refund for the $25 overcharge. You should see it reflected in your account within 3-5 business days. Regarding why this wasn't fixed previously, I do apologize. I've added a note to your account to prevent this from happening again. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?",
