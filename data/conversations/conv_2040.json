The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) gives you rights. You can send a debt validation letter to the collector. This letter requests proof that you owe the debt. I can provide a template for that, or suggest some resources for legal aid in your area. Would you like the template?",

They are generally prohibited from calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. your time, or at any time they know is inconvenient for you. Repeated calls can be harassment and you have recourse if they are harassing you. If you ignore the debt, the collector could potentially sue you. It's always best to respond, even if it's just to request validation. Remember, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive legal advice; please consult with an attorney for the best course of action. Would you like me to provide you with some contact info for local attorneys?",
