However, persistent headaches should always be evaluated by a medical professional to rule out other potential causes. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen might provide some relief. You could also try relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or stretching, to reduce muscle tension. But again, it's best to consult a doctor.",
