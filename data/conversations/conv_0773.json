For Chelsea boots, brands like Blundstone (more rugged) or Aquatalia (dressier) are good options. Pointed-toe flats... hmm, a lot depends on your budget there. Maybe check out Everlane for a good balance of quality and price?",

Look for brands that are transparent about their supply chains and have certifications like the Leather Working Group (LWG) Gold rating. Also, research the brand's sustainability practices and look for information on fair labor standards. Sorry I can't provide a definitive answer; it's a complex issue.",
