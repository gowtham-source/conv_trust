Regarding spice rubs, a brand like 'Traeger Grills' offers a variety of high-quality rubs that are well-regarded. They typically come in sets and fit comfortably in your budget. Do you have a preference for the types of meat your dad usually grills? That could help narrow down the recommendations.",

A good Traeger rub set with two or three different varieties costs around $20-$30. A basic but reliable meat thermometer could cost anywhere from $15-$40 depending on the brand and features. Some high end brands can be up to $100, so it depends how fancy you're looking for. If you want to be *very* budget conscious, the rubs provide the most value. You might even have enough left over to get some grilling gloves!",
