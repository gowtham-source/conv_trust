We have customer reviews indicating that it holds up well over time. However, predicting exact durability depends on individual usage. It's a challenging question to answer definitively without knowing your exact mileage and running style. We could cross-reference your current shoe size with the average wear time of similar customers who use the StrideMaster Pro.",
