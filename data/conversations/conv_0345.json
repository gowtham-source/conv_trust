Accuracy in dense forests can be affected by tree cover, potentially leading to signal loss or inaccuracies of 5-15 meters. However, models with GLONASS or Galileo support tend to perform better in challenging environments. I can filter the watches by those features, if you'd like? Or, I can compare a few specific models for you?",
