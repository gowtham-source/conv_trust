The 'Magnificent Mile Grand Hotel' is around $250/night, the 'Riverwalk Inn' is about $180/night, and the 'Downtown Budget Stay' is approximately $110/night. Do any of these sound interesting, or would you like more options?",

I found 'The Canine Comfort Hotel' which seems to allow pets and has a pool, priced around $195/night. There's also 'Aqua Pet Paradise' at about $210/night, also listed as pet-friendly with a pool. Availability for pet-friendly rooms can sometimes be limited, though.",

However, specific pet restrictions (like breed or size) and any associated fees would need to be confirmed directly with the hotel before booking. The prices I provided are estimates based on the base rate and may not include all taxes, resort fees, or other charges imposed by the hotel. You would see the final price including known fees during the booking confirmation process.",
