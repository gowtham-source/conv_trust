How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base is 6 feet away from the wall?\n\nFirst, we need a diagram and our knowns (length = 10, dx/dt = 2). Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 100\n\nCan you take it from there?",

Now you can substitute the values you know (x, y, and dx/dt) into your equation:  2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0. Solving this equation, you'll find that dy/dt = -1.5 ft/sec.
