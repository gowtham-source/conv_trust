It's F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses, and r is the distance between the centers of the objects. Tell me what information the problem gives you.",

Ensure the masses are in kilograms (kg), the distance is in meters (m), and then you can use the standard value for G (6.674 x 10^-11 N\u22c5m\u00b2/kg\u00b2). Make sure you square the distance in your calculation. Also, maybe double-check your calculator settings. Are you using scientific notation correctly? Sometimes there can be a calculation error from the calculator. Can you show me your work so far?",
