For protein, consider chicken thighs (usually cheaper than breasts) or canned tuna. Frozen vegetables are also a great way to save money and reduce food waste. Would you like me to generate a sample meal plan based on that, or perhaps suggest some specific recipes?",

Here's a preliminary meal plan idea: Monday: Chicken and vegetable stir-fry with rice. Tuesday: Lentil soup (very budget-friendly and can be customized). Wednesday: Pasta with tomato sauce and ground chicken (consider buying the larger ground chicken if in budget). Thursday: Eggs and toast with a side of frozen vegetables. Friday: Chicken tacos. Saturday: Leftovers. Sunday: Simple chicken and rice. I recommend visiting your local grocery stores' websites to view weekly specials. Does this seem like a reasonable starting point, or would you like adjustments?",
