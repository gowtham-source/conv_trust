For protein, consider chicken thighs (usually cheaper than breasts) or canned tuna. Frozen vegetables are also a great way to save money and reduce food waste. Would you like me to generate a sample meal plan based on that, or perhaps suggest some specific recipes?",

      "utterance": "Okay, I'll factor in your picky eating and your partner's aversion to fish. This may slightly impact the budget due to limited options. Here's a preliminary meal plan idea: Monday: Chicken and vegetable stir-fry with rice. Tuesday: Lentil soup (very budget-friendly and can be customized). Wednesday: Pasta with tomato sauce and ground chicken (consider buying the larger ground chicken if in budget). Thursday: Eggs and toast with a side of frozen vegetables. Friday: Chicken tacos. Saturday: Leftovers. Sunday: Simple chicken and rice. I recommend visiting your local grocery stores' websites to view weekly specials. Does this seem like a reasonable starting point, or would you like adjustments?",

Local farmers' markets might offer good deals, but it would be best if you compared pricing. I can provide some recipe ideas that feature seasonal produce in season during the time of year you are currently at. Let me know the current date.",
