      "utterance": "Hello! Painting wood trim is a great way to refresh a room. The first step is always preparation. You'll want to clean the trim thoroughly, remove any old caulk or peeling paint, and lightly sand the surface to create a good base for the new paint to adhere to. Once it's smooth and clean, you can apply a primer before painting with your desired topcoat.",

For peeling areas, you'll need to scrape away all loose paint. For dents, you can use wood filler or spackle, sand it smooth once dry. While it adds time, this prep work is crucial for a professional-looking and long-lasting result.",

      "utterance": "Apologies for the ambiguity. For maximum adhesion over unknown or mixed paint types (like potential oil over wood) and best performance in varying conditions including humidity, look for a high-quality *shellac-based* primer or a *water-based acrylic bonding primer* specifically labeled for 'blocking stains' and 'adhesion over glossy or challenging surfaces'. Shellac is excellent at blocking stains and adhering to anything, while high-end acrylic bonders offer great adhesion and easier cleanup. Check the can's description to confirm it's designed for your specific needs, particularly regarding adhesion over existing coatings and suitability for humid conditions during application and curing. Good ventilation is also key in humidity.",
