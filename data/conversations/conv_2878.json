Hypothetically, signs that warrant immediate medical attention for back pain can include numbness or tingling in the legs or feet, weakness in the legs, loss of bladder or bowel control, severe pain that doesn't improve with rest, or pain accompanied by fever or unexplained weight loss. A slipped disc might cause pain radiating down the leg (sciatica), while organ-related pain might have different patterns or associated symptoms.
