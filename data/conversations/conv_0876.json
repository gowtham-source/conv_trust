For each project, briefly outline the situation, the task you were responsible for, the specific actions you took, and the measurable results you achieved. Quantify your accomplishments whenever possible. For instance, instead of saying 'Managed a team,' try 'Led a cross-functional team of 7 engineers and 3 designers to deliver a key software update, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement within the first quarter.'",
