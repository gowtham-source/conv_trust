For each project, briefly outline the situation, the task you were responsible for, the specific actions you took, and the measurable results you achieved. Quantify your accomplishments whenever possible. For instance, instead of saying 'Managed a team,' try 'Led a cross-functional team of 7 engineers and 3 designers to deliver a key software update, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement within the first quarter.'",

Then, highlight 2-3 key skills or experiences that directly align with the requirements mentioned in the job posting. Provide specific examples of how you've demonstrated these skills in the past. Finally, express your enthusiasm for the company and the opportunity. Keep it concise and professional, ideally no more than one page. Generic cover letters are often overlooked.",
