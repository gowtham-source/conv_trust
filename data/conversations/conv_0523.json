It could be due to your deductible not being met, coinsurance, or non-covered services. I can't determine billing accuracy, or access the specifics of your plan. I would recommend calling Blue Cross Blue Shield directly and providing them with the CPT code 99214. Ask them to explain the claim processing and your remaining deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. They will be able to provide specifics to your plan.",
