I cannot do that because I am not a licensed attorney and don't have all the specific facts of your case. Providing legal *information* means explaining general concepts, relevant statutes, or typical procedures based on jurisdiction. For instance, I can tell you about California's \"repair and deduct\" or \"abandonment\" options in a general sense, but I cannot advise you on whether or how to apply them in your specific circumstance.",

      "utterance": "That specific question crosses the line into legal advice because it asks about the precise legal consequences of a particular action in your situation. I absolutely cannot tell you what will happen *exactly* if you stop paying rent. Withholding rent can have serious legal repercussions, including potential eviction proceedings, even if your landlord is in violation of repair obligations. The rules around remedies like 'repair and deduct' or rent withholding in California and San Francisco are complex, have specific procedural requirements, and depend heavily on the exact facts of your case. I strongly advise consulting with a qualified attorney or a tenant rights organization in San Francisco for advice specific to your situation before taking any action.",

For tenant issues in San Francisco, excellent resources include: the San Francisco Rent Board (for information and mediation services), tenant advocacy non-profits like the Tenant Union or Legal Assistance to the Elderly (if applicable), and the State Bar of California or the Bar Association of San Francisco for lawyer referral services. Looking for 'tenant rights San Francisco' online will also yield relevant government and non-profit websites that provide detailed information on local ordinances and procedures.
