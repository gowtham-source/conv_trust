      "utterance": "That's a great question! Quantifying opportunity cost often involves a simplified model or estimation, as it represents a *potential* outcome. One common method is using the Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) model. This model shows the maximum possible output combinations of two goods or services an economy can achieve when all resources are fully and efficiently employed. By examining the slope of the PPF at a particular production point, you can estimate the opportunity cost of producing more of one good in terms of the other. It gives you a good approximation, but rarely a perfect real-world answer. There are more complex economic models as well, but those are typically case-specific.",
