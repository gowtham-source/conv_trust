While Sennheiser does have professional audio equipment, the Momentum series is their premium consumer line known for excellent sound quality and effective noise cancellation, making them competitive for commuting. However, comfort and size perception can certainly be subjective. Let's refine further. Would you prefer to see more options that are explicitly known for a lighter or more compact design compared to typical over-ear models, similar to the profiles of the Sony and Bose?",

Okay, and here's a trickier one: out of *all* the ones you've mentioned so far (including that Sennheiser), which one has the *absolute best* passive noise isolation *when the battery dies* and the ANC is off? Also, can you confirm which of those models have a physical audio jack and are currently available in a dark blue or navy color?",

      "utterance": "Pinpointing the 'absolute best' passive noise isolation when the battery is dead is quite specific and can vary slightly based on head shape and fit. It's not a metric typically highlighted in standard specifications. However, models with robust build quality, like the Sony WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort 45, generally offer solid passive sealing. Regarding a physical audio jack, both the Sony WH-1000XM5 and the Bose QuietComfort 45 *do* include a 3.5mm audio port for wired listening. Checking real-time stock levels and specific color availability like 'dark blue' or 'navy' across multiple models simultaneously is unfortunately beyond the scope of my current capabilities. You would need to check the individual product pages directly on the store's website for the most accurate, up-to-the-minute information on available colors and stock.",
