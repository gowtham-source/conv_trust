For example, a one-pound bag of dried lentils is significantly less expensive than several cans of pre-cooked lentils. Store brand pasta and canned tomatoes are usually the most economical options. For eggs, look for the least expensive option – white or brown usually makes no difference in terms of nutrition, and sometimes the less-expensive eggs are perfectly fine. Avoid organic or specialty eggs if you're trying to save money.",
