For example, a one-pound bag of dried lentils is significantly less expensive than several cans of pre-cooked lentils. Store brand pasta and canned tomatoes are usually the most economical options. For eggs, look for the least expensive option \u2013 white or brown usually makes no difference in terms of nutrition, and sometimes the less-expensive eggs are perfectly fine.
