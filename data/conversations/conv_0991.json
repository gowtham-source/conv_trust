      "utterance": "Thank you for providing that information. I've reviewed the claims. For John Smith, the denial stemmed from a lack of detailed progress notes justifying the continued need for physical therapy. For Jane Doe, the pre-authorization documentation didn't explicitly outline the treatment plan's goals and expected outcomes clearly enough. And for Robert Jones, the diagnosis code didn't align well with the service provided; a more specific code would be beneficial. As for your question about proactive documentation, including detailed progress notes that clearly demonstrate improvement, outlining specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals in your treatment plans, and ensuring accurate and specific diagnosis coding are all crucial steps. Additionally, consider including supporting documentation like functional outcome assessments whenever possible. It can also be beneficial to verify payer-specific medical necessity requirements before submitting claims.",
