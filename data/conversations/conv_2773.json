If formal A/B testing experience is truly limited, focus more heavily on your analytical skills and the results you achieved from *any* kind of comparative analysis. You could say something like, 'Applied analytical skills to evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing tactics, driving data-informed decisions.' This highlights your ability to analyze and make decisions based on data comparison without explicitly claiming A/B testing experience you don't have.
