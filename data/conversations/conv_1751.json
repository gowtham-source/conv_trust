      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely! I can definitely work with that. For $50, vegetarian, and excluding lentils, I recommend focusing on eggs, beans, pasta, and seasonal vegetables. Here's a sample meal plan:\n\n*   **Breakfasts (7 days):** Oatmeal with fruit and nuts (oats are very affordable).\n*   **Lunches (7 days):** Veggie sandwiches on whole-wheat bread with hummus.\n*   **Dinners (7 days):** Pasta with marinara sauce and sauteed vegetables, topped with a fried egg.\n\nThis is a very basic plan. It might be hard to stay within budget considering inflation. I have found some store deals but they may vary depending on where you live. Could you let me know what city you are in?",
