Instead of focusing solely on sales figures, highlight how your coordination led to improved efficiency, reduced delays, or better communication within the team. You could say something like, 'Coordinated cross-functional teams of 5-7 members, resulting in a 15% reduction in project completion time.' Remember to always try to quantify the impact of your actions, even if it's not directly related to revenue. Or, focus on things like increased client satisfaction if you have that data.
