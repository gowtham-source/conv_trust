What do you enjoy working on? 2. Research upcoming hackathons. Look for events that align with your interests and skill level. Websites like Devpost and Eventbrite can be helpful. 3. Form a team (or consider going solo). Having a team can be beneficial, especially for larger projects. 4. Brainstorm project ideas. Think about problems you can solve or cool things you can build.",
