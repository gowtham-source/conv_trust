The ThermoPro TP20 Wireless Meat Thermometer is highly rated for its accuracy and range. We also have the Grill Daddy Pro Grill Brush, which is consistently a bestseller. Finally, the Steven Raichlen Best of Barbecue Ultimate Suede Grilling Gloves are also a great choice. Would you like more details on any of these?",

      "utterance": "Understood. Let me refine the search. How about the 'GrillArt Grill Smoker Box'? It allows him to add wood chips to his gas grill for a smoky flavor. Or, for a more unique option, the 'Cuisinart Pizza Grilling Kit' could be interesting if he enjoys making pizzas. We also carry a 'Cave Tools BBQ Dragon Fan Blower' which helps quickly ignite charcoal or control flare-ups. Would any of those be more along the lines of what you're looking for? Alternatively, what types of grilling does he typically do? Knowing if he prefers smoking, searing, or general BBQing would help me narrow the results.",
