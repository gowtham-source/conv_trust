Here's what I recommend: Start by brainstorming several project ideas, then narrow them down based on your skill level, the available time, and the hackathon's theme. Consider using a simple scoring system to rank your ideas, and focus on projects with a clear scope and achievable goals. For instance, what themes are most likely to be present at the hackathon you're going to?",

Look for online platforms or forums dedicated to the hackathon, like Discord servers or dedicated pages on the hackathon's website. You can also reach out on social media or your university's tech clubs. Be specific about your skills and the type of team you're looking for. Even if you don't find a full team, you can still participate solo. Many hackathons have resources or mentors to help. Remember that starting is often the hardest step.
