To maximize your savings, I recommend checking local grocery store websites or apps for current sales and using generic/store brand products where possible. Prices can change rapidly, but I can try to generate a list using the current average prices from major grocery chains. I will then adjust my price estimations on the next generated list to reflect any sales you might have found. Unfortunately, I cannot factor in taxes. If you want to refine the list, you can provide a list of stores, and I can factor in the pricing of their website if you provide the URL. Do you want me to proceed with generating the shopping list based on average prices from major retailers?",
