Given your long work hours, inconsistent diet, and lack of sufficient sleep, it is not surprising that you're experiencing fatigue and increased illness. I would suggest, whenever possible, prioritizing 7-9 hours of sleep per night, eating a more balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, and finding ways to manage your stress, maybe through exercise or mindfulness. However, I'm not a medical professional, so I strongly recommend consulting with your doctor.",

Here are a few tips that might help: 1) Try to establish a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. 2) Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or reading a book. 3) Avoid screen time (phones, tablets, computers) for at least an hour before bed. 4) Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. 5) You could also consider a short nap during the day if you feel tired, but keep it brief (20-30 minutes) to avoid disrupting your nighttime sleep. But again, consult with your doctor if it persists.",
