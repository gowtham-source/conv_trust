      "utterance": "Certainly. If a formal demand letter doesn't resolve the issue, your options typically include mediation, arbitration, or initiating a lawsuit. The likelihood of success in court depends heavily on the specific jurisdiction, the strength of your evidence, and the persuasiveness of your argument. Court costs can vary significantly, but typically involve filing fees, attorney fees (if you choose to hire one), and potentially expert witness fees. Unfortunately, I can't give you a concrete estimate of success or cost without a more thorough case evaluation. However, small claims court might be a cost-effective option if the invoice amount falls within its jurisdictional limit. Let's start with that demand letter template, and then we can discuss exploring mediation as an alternative if needed.",
