The Dell typically has a sleeker design and often a slightly better screen, but the HP offers more features for the money (like the touchscreen). Performance is similar. If design and build quality are paramount, then the Dell *might* justify the price. If you want value for money and good features, go with the HP. I'd recommend reading some reviews to decide.",
