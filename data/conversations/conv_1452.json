In the absence of clear language in the partnership agreement, a court would likely consider state and federal laws, prior practices of the partnership, and any evidence of who created the intellectual property. In most cases, this would include the consideration of written records as well as any available witness testimony. I highly recommend consulting with an attorney experienced in intellectual property and business law. They can assess the specific details of your situation and advise you on the best course of action.",
