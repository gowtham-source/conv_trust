      "utterance": "That's a common point of confusion! For interior walls like a living room, a latex-based paint is almost always recommended. It's easier to clean up with water, dries faster, and has fewer fumes than oil-based paint. For the finish, 'eggshell' or 'satin' are popular choices. Eggshell has a slight sheen and is durable, while satin has a bit more sheen and is very washable, good for higher traffic areas.",

Is there *ever* a situation where you can realistically skip primer without everything falling apart? Like, if the existing paint is in perfect condition and the same sheen?",

      "utterance": "Apologies, I understand your concern about the extra step. While primer is generally best practice, you *might* be able to skip it on previously painted surfaces in good condition if you are using a high-quality paint specifically labeled as 'paint and primer in one' and are not drastically changing the color or sheen. However, even then, results can vary depending on the original wall surface and paint. It's a calculated risk; for guaranteed adhesion and true color, primer is still the professional recommendation.",
