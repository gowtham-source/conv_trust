Let the primer dry completely before painting. Does that help?",

Apply the paint in thin, even coats, slightly overlapping each stroke. Avoid pressing too hard on the brush. For the final coat, brush in long, smooth strokes in the same direction. Consider using a paint extender, which slows drying time and allows the paint to level out, reducing visible brushstrokes. And finally, practice! A small, inconspicuous area can be a great place to hone your technique.",
