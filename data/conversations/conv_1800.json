For around $800, look for models with:\n\n*   An AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel Core i5 processor (or better).\n*   Integrated graphics (like AMD Radeon Graphics) might suffice for less demanding games, but dedicated graphics (like NVIDIA GeForce MX series or better, if possible within budget) will significantly improve performance. Check the specific game's recommended system requirements. Consider looking for slightly used laptops if budget is a constraint to get the best gaming performance. I can help you narrow down specific models once you provide me with a few games you plan on playing!",
