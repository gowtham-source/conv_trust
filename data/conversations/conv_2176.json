Both offer good performance for general use and should have options within your price range with decent battery life. The exact models available may vary based on current sales and stock, so I'd recommend checking retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, or Newegg. You may also find refurbished options within your budget that can give you more performance for your money. One thing to consider is the processor: for video editing, look for an Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor or better. Refurbished models usually have a shorter warranty, but are thoroughly tested by the seller.",
