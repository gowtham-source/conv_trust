While a direct genre label for 'ambient post-rock' isn't universally established, you might find what you're looking for by searching for instrumental post-rock bands known for atmospheric soundscapes. Consider artists like Explosions in the Sky (though some tracks are more intense), This Will Destroy You, or perhaps some tracks by Hammock. These groups often feature expansive, calming instrumental sections, although they can build dynamically. It's a bit of a cross-genre exploration.",
