Both are excellent choices for road running and light trails and typically fall within your budget. The Brooks Ghost offers a good balance of cushioning and responsiveness, while the Saucony Kinvara is lighter and more geared toward speed. I can provide you with links if you'd like. However, do you have any specific preferences on the cushioning, support, or drop?",

      "utterance": "You raise a good point. The Brooks Ghost offers more overall cushioning and stability, making it a great choice if you need more support. The Saucony Kinvara provides less cushioning but allows a more natural feel with less support, which can be better if you have a neutral gait and prefer a more flexible shoe. It really depends on your running style and any history of injuries. Consider visiting a local running store to try on both models, if possible. They can analyze your gait and help you decide. Alternatively, based on your mileage and preferred terrain, either option is a solid choice. You can check reviews as well. Are you ready to proceed?",
