This is done to expedite the repair process. Your insurance company may then pursue subrogation against the at-fault party to recover the costs. This can sometimes be faster than dealing directly with the other insurance company, especially if there are disputes about liability. Additionally, your policy may offer coverages that the other driver's policy does not, such as rental car reimbursement. I hope this helps to clarify things.",
