It's a great fantasy novel with a compelling story and well-developed characters, but it's not overly complicated. Another option is 'Mistborn: The Final Empire' by Brandon Sanderson. Both are very popular and well-regarded.",

      "utterance": "Alright, 'The Goblin Emperor' sounds interesting! Quick question, and this might be hard: if magic exists in a book, does that automatically make it fantasy? Like, what about a book that's set in modern times but has some magical realism elements? Is that still fantasy?",

      "speaker": "agent",
      "utterance": "That's a very insightful question! Generally, if the primary focus of the story revolves around magic systems, fantastical creatures, or the implications of a magical world, it falls under fantasy. Magical realism, while containing magical elements, typically uses them to explore themes within a realistic setting, rather than making the magic the central plot driver. So, it's often considered a separate genre, though there can be overlap.",
