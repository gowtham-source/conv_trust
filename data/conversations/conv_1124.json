While you can't completely eliminate the risk of getting sick, you can significantly strengthen your immune system by maintaining a healthy lifestyle \u2013 a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, regular exercise, adequate sleep, stress management techniques, and avoiding smoking can all help.
