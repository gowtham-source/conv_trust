Use strong action verbs like 'Spearheaded', 'Implemented', or 'Delivered'. Structure them using the CAR (Challenge, Action, Result) or STAR method mentally. For instance, instead of 'Managed project timelines', you could say 'Reduced project delivery time by 15% by implementing agile methodologies, resulting in earlier product launch'.",
