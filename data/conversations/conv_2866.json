Finding an accessible *and* obscure British sci-fi horror from the 70s that *isn't* 'Alien' is a bit challenging, as 'Alien' is the major touchstone. While perhaps leaning more towards just horror or having minimal sci-fi, films like 'Quatermass and the Pit' (though slightly earlier) or 'Death Line' might fit parts of that description, but they are not strictly sci-fi horror in the way 'Alien' is. It's a very niche area!",
