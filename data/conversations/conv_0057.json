If, on average, 5 people enter every minute and 5 people leave every minute, the overall number of people in the room stays relatively constant. The entering and leaving are still happening (the reaction is still occurring), but the net change is zero (equilibrium). Does that analogy help at all?",

A Keq close to 1 means that significant amounts of both reactants and products are present at equilibrium.

      "utterance": "Yeah, that's helpful! So, a high Keq means more products. Makes sense. Okay, but here's a tricky one: If you have a complex reaction with multiple steps, how does the Keq of the overall reaction relate to the Keq values of the individual steps? Is there a general rule, or does it depend on the specific reaction mechanism?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! For a multi-step reaction, the overall Keq is the product of the Keq values for each individual step. In other words, Keq(overall) = Keq1 * Keq2 * Keq3, and so on. This is because each step contributes to the overall equilibrium, and their equilibrium constants are multiplied to reflect the combined effect. This applies as long as the steps are elementary reactions. Does that answer your question?",
