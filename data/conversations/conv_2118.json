Generally, you could potentially recover lost wages, benefits, emotional distress damages, and sometimes even punitive damages. However, I can't provide an estimate without knowing the specifics of your employment contract, the laws in your location, and the evidence available. The amount could range from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's crucial to discuss this with an attorney.",
