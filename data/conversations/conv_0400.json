You could get 2-3 pairs of jeans (aim for sales!), several t-shirts, and a sweater within that price range. Would you like some specific item suggestions or links to their websites?",

Old Navy's parent company, Gap Inc., has similar challenges. For more ethically sound (though potentially pricier) options, consider looking for sales at stores like Everlane or PACT. Alternatively, thrifting and consignment stores are excellent for finding unique and sustainable pieces within your budget.

Check the garment carefully for stains, tears, and pilling. Don't be afraid to try things on, even if they seem slightly off; tailoring can be surprisingly affordable. Also, visit thrift stores in wealthier neighborhoods, as they often have better quality donations.",
