Old Navy's parent company, Gap Inc., has similar challenges. For more ethically sound (though potentially pricier) options, consider looking for sales at stores like Everlane or PACT. Alternatively, thrifting and consignment stores are excellent for finding unique and sustainable pieces within your budget.
