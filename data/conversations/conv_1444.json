The light-dependent reactions capture energy from sunlight and convert it into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. This energy is then used to fuel the Calvin cycle, which produces glucose. Does that help clarify things a bit?",

      "utterance": "Apologies, I am still under development, and may not be able to provide a completely accurate and comprehensive explanation of complex scientific processes. However, the light-dependent reactions involve photosystems (II and I), which capture light energy and use it to excite electrons. These high-energy electrons are passed along an electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane. This creates a proton gradient that drives ATP synthase to produce ATP. I recommend checking out a reputable educational website or YouTube channel for a visual explanation. Alternatively, you could consider other questions.",
