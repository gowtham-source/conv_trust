Since you have a fixed-price contract and the contractor is significantly behind schedule with incomplete work, you likely have grounds to pursue legal action. The next step would usually be to send a 'notice of breach' to the contractor. This formally informs them of the breach and demands a remedy.",

It should also clearly state that if they fail to remedy the breach, you will pursue legal action. You may find templates online, but I strongly advise having an attorney review it before sending.",

      "speaker": "agent",
      "utterance": "That's a challenging question, and the answer is, it depends. Most contracts have clauses addressing unforeseen circumstances, sometimes called 'force majeure' clauses. Whether material delays excuse the breach hinges on the specific language in your contract, the nature of the delays, and whether the contractor took reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of those delays. If the contract does not address unforeseen circumstances, the concept of 'impossibility of performance' or 'frustration of purpose' may apply, but these are often difficult to prove. You would really need a lawyer to look at the specific contract wording.",
