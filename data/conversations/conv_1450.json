While both movies have complex plots, 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' relies more on character development, subtle clues, and a dense atmosphere, whereas 'Inception' uses multiple layers of dreams and visual spectacle to create complexity. Think of it like this: 'Inception' is complex like a Rubik's Cube, while 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is complex like a carefully constructed crossword puzzle. It really depends on the type of complex you prefer. Perhaps you'd find it more complex than 'Inception' because it is less flashy and requires more attention to detail.",
