In terms of 'thought-provoking,'  you could also explore the works of Ursula K. Le Guin, particularly 'The Dispossessed.' It offers a complex examination of societal structures. Another, less-known novel is 'Roadside Picnic' by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky; a Russian Sci-Fi book with lots of thought-provoking themes, although, it is not your typical sci-fi.",
