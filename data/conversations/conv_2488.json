For water damage claims with initial documentation provided, our typical internal target for assigning an adjuster is 2-3 business days from submission. While processing times aren't guaranteed SLAs, your claim was submitted three business days ago, so it should be assigned very soon, likely within the next business day. Once assigned, the adjuster will contact you directly to arrange an inspection and discuss next steps. I apologize for the vague response earlier; we are working to get an adjuster assigned promptly.",
