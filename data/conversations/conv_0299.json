I can help you configure claim scrubbing rules within Medisoft to identify and correct common errors *before* you submit the claims, potentially reducing rejections. Also, can you provide the provider NPI and the corresponding taxonomy code? I can verify that information is accurately listed with PECOS, which often leads to claim rejections if out of date.",

While I can't guarantee I can perfectly handle every edge case given the nuances of insurance policies, I can provide access to regularly updated payer rules databases and integrate them into your claim scrubbing process. This will allow Medisoft to flag potential mismatches based on known payer requirements. We can also set up alerts for diagnosis codes that typically require pre-authorization for certain procedures. For hands-on training on Medisoft's claim scrubbing features, I can provide links to relevant tutorials and documentation, or connect you with a Medisoft certified consultant.",
