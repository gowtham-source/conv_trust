Replacing just the washer is often possible, but it requires disconnecting that section of the pipe. You'll need tools like slip-joint pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen the retaining nut. Given that you're dealing with drain lines and potential water damage, accessing and replacing that specific washer safely might be complex without prior plumbing experience. It's challenging to give precise instructions without seeing the specific configuration.",

Sometimes, debris lodged near the washer can also cause a leak. You could try disconnecting that specific joint *carefully* to inspect the washer and clear any obvious blockages, if you feel confident doing so. Just make sure to have a bucket underneath and turn off the water supply *to the faucet* beforehand to prevent accidental water flow while working on the drain.",

For a drain pipe leak, you don't need to turn off the main water supply; turning off the faucet ensures no new water enters the drain while you're working. Thank you for catching that! If you decide to replace the washer, you'd typically need adjustable pliers (like channel locks or slip-joint pliers) to loosen the slip nut, a replacement slip-joint washer of the correct size for your pipe (usually 1 1/2 inch or 1 1/4 inch for sink drains), and a bucket to catch residual water. Inspect the old washer and the pipe ends when you take it apart to ensure the pipe itself isn't cracked.",
