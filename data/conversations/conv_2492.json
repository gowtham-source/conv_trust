My suggestions are based on finding sales or checking stores known for lower price points consistently. Another approach is to focus on versatile pieces you can get multiple uses from, like a good quality basic tee or versatile sneakers, and build outfits around those. Also, definitely explore second-hand apps or local consignment shops for better value on potentially higher quality items.",
