If the tree was healthy and the fall was caused by an act of God (like a particularly severe storm), the liability may be less clear. However, if the tree was diseased or neglected, your neighbor might be liable. Do you have any evidence that the tree was unhealthy or that your neighbor knew it posed a risk?",
