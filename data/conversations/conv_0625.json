If the tree was healthy and the fall was caused by an act of God (like a particularly severe storm), the liability may be less clear. However, if the tree was diseased or neglected, your neighbor might be liable. Do you have any evidence that the tree was unhealthy or that your neighbor knew it posed a risk?",

However, it's best if you had sent a certified letter, to avoid issues of proof later on. Do you have any photographic evidence of the tree's condition before it fell?",

This means demonstrating that a reasonable person would have recognized the condition of the tree.

Also, the age of the tree may be important. What kind of tree was it?",
