That being said, common causes for headaches include tension headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches. You could try improving your sleep schedule, drinking plenty of water and reducing stress. Avoid or reduce any known triggers like alcohol or certain foods. If the symptoms worsen or include other symptoms, seek professional medical attention immediately. If you are having serious problems with the headaches such as vision change, then you should also go to the emergency room.",
