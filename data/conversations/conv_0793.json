Try to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Ensure you're getting adequate sleep (7-8 hours), practice good posture, and try stress-reducing activities like yoga or meditation. Limiting caffeine and alcohol intake may also help.",

These can include a sudden, severe headache, vision changes, neck stiffness, seizures, or loss of consciousness. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. As I mentioned earlier, a doctor can properly evaluate your symptoms and medical history to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
