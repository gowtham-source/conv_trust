Both will require details about the transaction and your reason for disputing it. The dispute process often involves a waiting period for investigation, while the fraud specialist can immediately investigate common fraud patterns or other suspicious account activity. Please note that fraud specialists are only available during business hours. I am unsure of the exact time it may take in both scenarios.",
