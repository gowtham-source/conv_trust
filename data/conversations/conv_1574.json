For the 'Action' part, describe what you did *specifically* to recover from the situation and prevent it from happening again. For the 'Result,' emphasize the steps you took to prevent a repeat of the outage. Be specific, mentioning things like: 'I immediately rolled back the changes,' 'I then identified the root cause and...'. I can help you refine a complete answer using your example.",
