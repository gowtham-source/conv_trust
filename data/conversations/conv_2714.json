Since you've replaced the batteries, let's try a few more steps. Please ensure the unifying receiver (USB dongle) is securely plugged into a USB port on your computer. Try a different USB port if possible. Also, check if the power switch on the bottom of the mouse is definitely in the 'on' position.",

The steps we've taken, like checking power and the receiver connection, are the primary troubleshooting steps for this kind of issue. Given that new batteries didn't help and there are no lights, it might indicate a deeper internal problem. For the MX Master 3, sometimes re-pairing the mouse with the receiver using the Logitech Options software can help, but if the mouse itself isn't powering on, that might not be possible. Based on the lack of power indicators, it may require repair or replacement. Would you like me to look up options for warranty service or support for your specific region?",
