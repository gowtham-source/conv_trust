We can also work on tackling common tricky questions like the one about weaknesses. The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is indeed a standard framework to help structure your answers. We can practice breaking down your experiences into these components.",

And about the weaknesses question - how do you answer 'What's your biggest weakness?' effectively *without* sounding clich\u00e9 or fake? Everyone says pick a 'good' weakness, but that feels dishonest. Like, how do you actually give a real weakness but frame it right? This is what truly frustrates me.",

      "utterance": "That's a very insightful and common frustration, and it leads to a great question. The key isn't necessarily picking a 'good' weakness, but demonstrating self-awareness and proactive effort towards improvement. Choose a genuine weakness that is relevant to the role but not a core requirement, or one you have actively been working to mitigate. Describe the weakness honestly, *then* immediately explain the concrete steps you are taking to improve upon it, and ideally, show some progress or a positive outcome from your efforts. This shows growth mindset and initiative rather than just listing a fault.",
