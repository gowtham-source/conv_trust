For a psychological thriller standalone, you might consider \"Before I Go to Sleep\" by S.J. Watson, which deals with memory loss and suspense. Another option could be \"The Guest List\" by Lucy Fokley, which has a locked-room mystery feel with psychological elements. These are well-regarded but perhaps slightly less ubiquitous than the ones I first mentioned. Let me know if those sound closer to what you're looking for!",
