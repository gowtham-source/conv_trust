Make sure the threads are aligned before you start tightening, and only tighten them by hand until they're snug. Then, use a wrench to give it a quarter to half turn more. However, I am still under development, and don't have a perfect understanding of how to handle that specific task. You might want to consult a professional on this matter.",
