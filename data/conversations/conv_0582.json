As for Chelsea boots under $200, Clarks offers some good options. They have a variety of styles, from classic suede to more contemporary leather versions. Would you like me to look for specific links or images of any of those?",

Regarding the 'classic' and 'chunky sneaker' pairing, I was referring to the overall aesthetic. While chunky sneakers are a modern trend, some models, like the Adidas Ozweego or New Balance 530, draw inspiration from retro running shoes and thus possess a 'classic' design language despite being chunky. It's about finding a balance between a trendy silhouette and a timeless design. Hope that clarifies things!",
