It frequently falls within your budget and offers a great user experience. Alternatively, some configurations of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 might be on sale and within budget if you're lucky.

This is the date until which the device will receive automatic software updates. You can usually find the AUE date for a specific Chromebook model by searching online for \"[Model Name] AUE date\" or by checking Google's official Chromebook support pages. For the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5, I believe the AUE date is sometime in 2028, but I would strongly suggest you verify that date to ensure it meets your needs since Lenovo sometimes has sub-models with different AUEs.",
