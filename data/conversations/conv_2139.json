If so, and you're looking for something newer, I can suggest some more recent titles. Or perhaps you prefer a specific subgenre like high fantasy, urban fantasy, or epic fantasy?",

Also, 'Piranesi' by Susanna Clarke has a unique setting.  It's not strictly fantasy in the traditional sense, but it has fantasy elements and is well-regarded. For something outside of those, I'll have to look further into my database.  Please give me a moment...",
