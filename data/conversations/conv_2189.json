Regarding your second question: Finding a direct 'John Wick' equivalent with a female lead is tough, but I'd recommend checking out 'Atomic Blonde' and 'Kate'. They both feature strong female leads with similar action styles. Hopefully, those recommendations are helpful!",

The line can be blurry, but generally, action movies emphasize physical conflict, stunts, and fast-paced sequences, often involving explosions, fights, and chases. Adventure movies often feature exploration, quests, and overcoming obstacles, sometimes with action elements. The focus tends to be more on the journey and discovery in adventure films, whereas action movies prioritize the thrill of the fight, and often have simpler plots. It's often a matter of emphasis. Enjoy your movies!",
