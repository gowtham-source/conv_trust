Based on the information you've provided, you should consider the following: \n\n1.  **Document Everything:** Keep records of all communication with the insurance company, medical bills, and any vehicle damage.\n2.  **Seek Medical Attention:** Even if your injuries seem minor, get checked out by a doctor and keep those records. This is particularly important for whiplash.\n3.  **Gather Evidence:** Collect any police reports, photos of the accident scene, and witness information.\n4.  **Consult an Attorney:** This is generally a good idea when dealing with insurance companies, especially when there are injuries involved and the fault is clear. They can help navigate the legal process. \n\nWould you like assistance finding local attorneys specializing in car accidents?",

Generally, the lack of collision coverage on your vehicle doesn't directly impact your ability to claim for your *injuries* against the other driver's liability insurance. However, it will impact your ability to get your own vehicle fixed or replaced through your own insurance. Your claim for property damage will depend on the other driver's insurance coverage. It is important to understand the terms of your coverage though. I recommend contacting a lawyer for a more personalized opinion regarding that subject. I can help you find an attorney if you wish.",
