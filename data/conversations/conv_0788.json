While the documentation does state the physician's reasoning, the payer's guidelines require specific ICD-10 codes to be linked to the CPT code for the procedure. I see that the primary diagnosis code listed doesn't directly support the procedure according to their policy. Have you checked if perhaps there is a more specific, payable diagnosis code that could be used? I can also provide a link to the payer's medical policy if that would be helpful.",
