Be prepared for a little water to drip. Then, detach the old faucet from the countertop. This usually involves removing nuts under the sink. This is where a basin wrench can be helpful, but you can usually do it with an adjustable wrench if you have enough room.",

Make sure you apply plumber's tape to all threaded connections before connecting the supply lines. Can you send me a picture of the parts?",

If that doesn't work, you might need to tighten the nut further, but be careful not to overtighten it and damage the connection. If the leak persists, the issue could be with the supply line itself (damaged threads) or the faucet's connection point (the seal might be faulty). If the leak continues, you'll want to replace the supply line or, potentially, the faucet depending on the issue.",
