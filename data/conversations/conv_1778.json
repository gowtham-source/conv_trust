The general recommendation is to prioritize paying off high-interest debt, like credit cards, while also contributing to your retirement plan, even if it's a small amount. Some financial advisors suggest a hybrid approach, allocating some money to debt reduction and some to savings. We can look at your specific debt and savings rates to determine the best allocation strategy for you.",

I will create a model showing how long it will take to pay off each debt, as well as the total interest paid, under different repayment scenarios.
