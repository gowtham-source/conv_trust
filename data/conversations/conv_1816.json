Regarding the missing package, it seems it was marked as delivered near your address. I recommend checking with your neighbors, as sometimes packages get delivered to the wrong address. If the package is still missing after that, we can initiate a claim with the carrier. However, I can't currently explain precisely why the delivery date was pushed back multiple times; the system just notes 'unforeseen circumstances'.",
