How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the radius is 5 cm?' Okay, I know I need to find dr/dt, but I'm completely lost as to where to start. I've tried using the volume formula, but it doesn't seem to work, I keep getting the wrong answer. Ugh, this is so frustrating!",

You've got the rate of change of volume (dV/dt = 10 cm\u00b3/s) and you want to find dr/dt when r = 5 cm. Now, let's differentiate the volume formula with respect to time (t).  That's where we start applying the related rates concepts.  Can you try differentiating the volume equation and seeing where that leads you?",
