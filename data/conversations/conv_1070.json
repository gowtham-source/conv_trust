      "utterance": "That's a valid concern. While inflation does erode the purchasing power of your returns, the key benefit of investing, especially over the long term, is the power of compounding. Reinvesting your earnings allows your money to grow exponentially over time. Moreover, 5-8% is an average; in some years, your returns could be significantly higher, outpacing inflation considerably. Additionally, consider that inflation rates fluctuate as well. To provide a more tailored assessment, could you share the current allocation of your 401k and Roth IRA? Then I can help you assess if you are appropriately diversified for your risk tolerance and time horizon.",
