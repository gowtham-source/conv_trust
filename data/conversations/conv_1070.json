Reinvesting your earnings allows your money to grow exponentially over time. Moreover, 5-8% is an average; in some years, your returns could be significantly higher, outpacing inflation considerably. Additionally, consider that inflation rates fluctuate as well. To provide a more tailored assessment, could you share the current allocation of your 401k and Roth IRA? Then I can help you assess if you are appropriately diversified for your risk tolerance and time horizon.",
