For sci-fi with more action and adventure, consider 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (Vol. 1 or 2), 'Edge of Tomorrow', or 'Starship Troopers' (if you like something a bit campy).  Regarding 'highly-regarded', I typically base that on a combination of critical reviews, audience scores from various platforms, and historical significance within the genre. It's a synthesis of multiple factors rather than just one metric.",
