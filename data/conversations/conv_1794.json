Given your enjoyment of *Divinity: Original Sin 2* and *Civilization VI*, and your thoughts on *The Witcher 3*, I would recommend looking at *Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous* (RPG) and *Endless Legend* (Strategy). *Pathfinder* offers deep RPG mechanics, and *Endless Legend* has strong 4X gameplay similar to *Civilization* but with a unique fantasy setting.

It now has overwhelmingly positive reviews. *Endless Legend* might be less familiar, but it's a critically acclaimed strategy game. Perhaps I can refine the recommendations. For RPGs, how about *Baldur's Gate 3*, which is getting incredible reviews now, and for strategy, *Age of Wonders 4* is a great choice.",
