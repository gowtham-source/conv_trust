Based on their slacker rock vibe and lyrical style, you might enjoy: Guided by Voices, or maybe Dinosaur Jr. Their sounds are similar, but there are no easy comparisons. Unfortunately, my database of obscure indie bands has been a bit spotty today. If you tell me what specifically you enjoy about Pavement, I might be able to narrow it down.",
