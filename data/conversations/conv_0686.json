Eggshell is good for hiding imperfections, while satin is slightly more durable and easier to clean. For the type of paint, I suggest a high-quality acrylic latex paint. It's durable, washable, and low in VOCs (volatile organic compounds), which is better for indoor air quality.",

      "utterance": "Yes, with heavily textured walls, preparation is key. I recommend using a high-build primer. These primers are thicker and designed to fill in some of the texture, creating a smoother surface for the paint to adhere to. Apply it in thin, even coats, allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next. You might need two or even three coats depending on the severity of the texture. Alternatively, you could consider skim coating the walls to completely smooth them out, but that is a much more involved process.",
