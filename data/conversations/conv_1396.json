I would recommend checking with your doctor's office, and asking them to verify whether they have the PA approval. They can often resubmit the claim, or send supporting documentation. You can also contact the insurance company directly to see if they have a record of the prior authorization. The number to call should be on your insurance card. Resolving this quickly will likely depend on the responsiveness of the doctor's office and the insurance company. Is there anything else I can help you with?",
