Hotel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Paris and Shangri-La Hotel, Paris are showing availability. Do either of those sound promising?",

For more budget-friendly options near the Eiffel Tower, I'd recommend checking out Hotel Mercure Paris Centre Eiffel. As for walking distance, the Plaza Athenee is about a 30-minute walk, and the Shangri-La is around 20 minutes. I'm still working on providing exact price quotes, but I can direct you to their booking pages if you want.",
