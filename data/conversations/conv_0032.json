Medical necessity, in this context, generally refers to services or supplies that are appropriate and required for the diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition. It's based on accepted standards of medical practice. While I don't see documentation of fatigue listed on the original claim submission, you can submit an appeal with supporting documentation, including the patient's reported fatigue, to potentially overturn the denial. The appeal should include updated diagnosis codes that reflect all conditions treated during the visit. Specifically, a more detailed diagnosis code beyond a simple cough would likely be beneficial. Would you like me to provide you with information on how to submit an appeal and acceptable diagnosis codes related to fatigue?",
