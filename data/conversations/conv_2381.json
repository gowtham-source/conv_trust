The fit and comfort may also be better, and the shoe might last longer. In some cases, you're also paying for the brand's exclusivity and design. It really depends on the specific shoe, of course, but those are the key differentiators. Should I offer any additional recommendations, or would you prefer to look at some of the aforementioned brands?",
