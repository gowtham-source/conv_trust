      "utterance": "That's great! Participating in a hackathon can be a fantastic learning experience. My top recommendation is to first clearly define the specific problem you want to address within the climate change domain. Then, brainstorm potential solutions that leverage AI. Finally, assess your current skills and identify any knowledge gaps you need to fill. Are you leaning towards any specific climate-related issues, such as renewable energy, carbon capture, or predicting extreme weather events?",

NASA's FIRMS dataset provides near real-time fire data, and you can find historical data from sources like the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) and the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project. As for your model, don't worry about it being perfect initially. The hackathon is a learning environment! Focus on iterating and improving. Start with a simple model and gradually increase complexity. You got this!",
