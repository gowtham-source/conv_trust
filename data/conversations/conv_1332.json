Here are a few general ideas:\n\n1.  **A Web-based Task Management Application:** Use your web dev skills and Python for the backend (maybe with a framework like Flask or Django). Focus on a clean UI/UX.\n2.  **A Data Visualization Tool:** If you enjoy data, find a dataset and create an interactive visualization using your HTML/CSS/JS skills (maybe using a library like D3.js).\n3.  **A Mobile App Prototype (using React Native or similar):** Showcase your UI/UX skills by building a prototype for a mobile app \u2013 even without full functionality.\n\nWould any of these interest you?",

      "utterance": "That's a great idea and a genuine problem! Parsing bank statements *is* challenging, but not impossible. Python has several libraries (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer`) for working with PDFs. You'd need to extract the text, identify key fields (date, description, amount), and use some rule-based categorization or, even better, train a machine learning model for more accurate categorization. It's ambitious for a weekend but definitely possible if you narrow the scope. Start by researching PDF parsing in Python and identifying common statement formats to focus your effort.
