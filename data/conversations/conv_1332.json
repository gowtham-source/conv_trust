Here are a few general ideas:\n\n1.  **A Web-based Task Management Application:** Use your web dev skills and Python for the backend (maybe with a framework like Flask or Django). Focus on a clean UI/UX.\n2.  **A Data Visualization Tool:** If you enjoy data, find a dataset and create an interactive visualization using your HTML/CSS/JS skills (maybe using a library like D3.js).\n3.  **A Mobile App Prototype (using React Native or similar):** Showcase your UI/UX skills by building a prototype for a mobile app â€“ even without full functionality.\n\nWould any of these interest you?",

      "utterance": "That's a great idea and a genuine problem! Parsing bank statements *is* challenging, but not impossible. Python has several libraries (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer`) for working with PDFs. You'd need to extract the text, identify key fields (date, description, amount), and use some rule-based categorization or, even better, train a machine learning model for more accurate categorization. It's ambitious for a weekend but definitely possible if you narrow the scope. Start by researching PDF parsing in Python and identifying common statement formats to focus your effort. Let me know if you need more advice on this project.",
