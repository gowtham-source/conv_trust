Finding those hotels with parking is a bit tricky, but I've got a list of hotels that *usually* offer it. There are hotels like The Thompson, The Kinzie Hotel, and The Hotel Lincoln. I'd strongly recommend checking their individual websites to confirm parking availability and costs during your stay, as these can change frequently. Would you like me to pull up prices for you?",
