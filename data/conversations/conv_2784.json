For casual everyday wear under $50, consider exploring retailers known for fast fashion and affordable basics like H&M, Zara (their sales section), Forever 21, or online marketplaces like ASOS or Shein. Look for versatile pieces like basic tees, affordable denim, simple sweaters, and versatile dresses that can be styled multiple ways.",

      "utterance": "That's a challenging goal within that specific budget range for new items, as ethical and sustainable production often increases costs. Some brands are making efforts, but truly sustainable options under $50 are limited. You might find some items within sales from brands focusing on ethics, or look into second-hand options like thrift stores or online resale platforms such as Poshmark or Depop, where you can often find higher-quality items at lower prices.",
