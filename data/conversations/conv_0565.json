      "utterance": "That's a very important question. The weight it carries depends on several factors, including the specific language of the contract regarding performance expectations, any clauses relating to 'material breach,' and applicable state laws governing partnership agreements. Courts often look at the 'totality of the circumstances' to determine if a breach is significant enough to warrant a change to the originally agreed terms. It might be beneficial to review the 'entire agreement' clause, if one exists, as well.",

      "speaker": "agent",
      "utterance": "Potentially, no. Even with vague wording, there are arguments that can be made. For example, you might be able to argue 'implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,' which exists in most jurisdictions. This means that even if the contract doesn't explicitly state it, your partner had an obligation to act reasonably and honestly in fulfilling his responsibilities. You could also explore the concept of 'unjust enrichment,' if your partner received benefits (profits) without adequately contributing. However, the success of these arguments depends heavily on the specific facts and the applicable jurisdiction.",
