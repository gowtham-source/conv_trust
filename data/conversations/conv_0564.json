For $50 a month, consider a Roth IRA invested in a low-cost index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). These are generally considered relatively safe and offer diversified exposure to the market. You may also want to talk to a professional financial advisor, but starting with research on reputable brokerages that offer fractional shares could be a good move.
