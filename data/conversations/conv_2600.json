Some airlines offer specific stopover programs. Regarding baggage, standard international flights often include one checked bag, but policies can vary significantly depending on the airline and fare class. Adding a planned stopover might mean your ticket is booked as a multi-city itinerary, which could have different baggage rules than a simple connecting flight on a single ticket.",
