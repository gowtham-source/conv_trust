Considering your budget of $200, here's a possible outfit suggestion: A nice pair of dark wash jeans ($50), a stylish top - maybe a blouse or a fitted sweater ($40), and ankle boots ($80), and a simple necklace to finish it off ($30). Does this sound appealing? Are there particular brands you prefer or want me to focus on?",

Instead of ankle boots, consider a pair of stylish sneakers - you could find some nice options from brands like Vans or Converse for around $60. That leaves more wiggle room for the top and accessories. This could work, or we can explore other options depending on specific style preferences for the shoes, if you have any?",
