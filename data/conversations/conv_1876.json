However, I've found a connecting flight with United for $820. It's slightly over budget but avoids extra costs for baggage. There is also a direct flight on British Airways for $1100. Would you like me to elaborate on these options? I am unable to provide pricing for checked baggage. I recommend checking the airlines website.",
