It can also involve applying existing technologies in novel ways, solving specific problems more effectively, improving user experience, or making these technologies more accessible to a wider audience. Consider focusing on a niche area or combining LLMs with other technologies to create something truly unique. Think about improving explainability or mitigating biases too. These areas are ripe for innovation.",
