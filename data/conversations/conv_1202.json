Many entry-level market research positions value strong analytical skills and a basic understanding of research methodologies, which you likely gained in your psychology program. One strategy is to focus on highlighting transferable skills in your resume and cover letter. Think about projects you worked on, even in college, where you analyzed data, conducted surveys, or identified trends. We can also explore online courses or certifications in market research to boost your qualifications. For instance, there are several Coursera courses on marketing analytics that are highly regarded.",

We can refine your job search to target these opportunities and tailor your application materials to highlight your strengths and enthusiasm. Networking can also be a powerful tool.
