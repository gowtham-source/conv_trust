For sneakers, you might like the Vans Old Skool (since you're familiar with the brand), the Adidas Stan Smith, or the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star. For boat shoes, check out Sperry Top-Siders or Rancourt & Co. What do you think of those?",

For the Sebago and Eastland options, I'd recommend checking the retailer's size chart and reading customer reviews, as they often provide insights on fit. Also, if possible, I'd suggest measuring your feet and comparing them to the size charts. Here are some links to those options on Zappos and Amazon, along with their size charts: [Links to Zappos and Amazon with specific products and size charts will appear here, but I am unable to provide real links].
