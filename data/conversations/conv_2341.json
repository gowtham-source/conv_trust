It's possible the denial relates to the frequency of physical therapy sessions, especially if the policy has a limit on the number of visits covered within a certain timeframe. Reviewing the physical therapy claim details and the patient's treatment plan is crucial. Could you provide those details? Also, I recommend you contact the payer directly to inquire about the specific reason for denial of the office visit and any potential frequency limitations related to the physical therapy. This will give the clearest answer, and I cannot resolve this. However, I can help with the research and data analysis.",
