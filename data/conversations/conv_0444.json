This can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the leather's thickness. Methods include wearing them for short periods initially, using leather conditioner to soften the material, and wearing thick socks. Some people also use a shoe stretcher to gently expand tight areas. There are also many articles online with specific tips and tricks!",
