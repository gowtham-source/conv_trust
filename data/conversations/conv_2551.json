      "utterance": "Apologies, my previous suggestion was a bit too generic. You're asking excellent questions about value and sustainability on a budget. Beyond fast fashion, consider stores known for good basics at reasonable prices like Uniqlo or Old Navy, especially when they have sales. Exploring second-hand options like thrift stores or online resale sites (ThredUp, Poshmark) can yield higher-quality pieces for less. Also, focusing on versatile basics you can mix and match helps maximize a limited budget.",

So, let's say I find some versatile pieces â€“ like a basic tee, some neutral pants, and a simple jacket or cardigan. How would I make that work for both casual day-to-day and dress it up slightly for the dinner party?",

      "utterance": "Excellent! Versatility is key. For a casual look: basic tee + neutral pants + cardigan. For the dinner party outfit using similar pieces: pair the neutral pants with a slightly dressier top (maybe one you already own, or find one second-hand for cheap) and use the jacket/cardigan if appropriate, or perhaps a different jacket. The 'dress up' factor often comes down to shoes and accessories. Swapping sneakers for loafers or simple heels, and adding some jewelry or a belt, can transform the entire look.",
