For single-point-of-failure mitigation, they typically use redundancy at multiple layers (hardware, network, and software). Sharding strategies often involve consistent hashing and failover mechanisms to redirect traffic. Ensuring data consistency across shards is complex, and Google likely uses a combination of techniques, including eventual consistency for certain operations, and potentially transactions/2-phase commit where stronger consistency is required, and also monitoring to address inconsistencies as they occur. Would you like more detail on any of these specific points?",
