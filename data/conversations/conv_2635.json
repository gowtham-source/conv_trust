Ask clarifying questions to understand the core problem; 2. Hypothesize potential solutions or frameworks based on your existing knowledge; 3. Describe *specific* resources you'd consult (e.g., relevant research papers, academic journals, expert networks, internal documentation if applicable); 4. Explain how you'd test or validate the approach; 5. Emphasize your ability to learn complex topics quickly and collaborate with others if needed.
