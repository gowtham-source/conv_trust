Based on your preferences for 'Blade Runner' and 'Arrival', and your aversion to space battles and jump scares, I would recommend the following: \n\n1.  **'Children of Men'**: A dystopian thriller with a focus on atmosphere and suspense.\n2.  **'Gattaca'**: A thought-provoking film exploring genetic engineering.\n3.  **'District 9'**: A unique and engaging science fiction film with social commentary.\n\nDo any of those sound interesting?",

If you're hesitant, I can substitute it with 'Primer', a low-budget time travel film that is very smart, but quite confusing for some. Alternatively, 'The Martian' might be a good fit, a more positive and less visually intense sci-fi film.",
