Considering that, let's adjust our approach. We can look for a dress closer to $100-$120 to allow room for shoes and accessories. I can search for options on those sites considering that, or perhaps we could look at a dress from a site like SHEIN.",

      "utterance": "That's a very valid concern. Judging quality online can be tricky. Here's what I recommend: prioritize items with detailed product descriptions and high-quality photos. Read the customer reviews carefully, paying attention to comments about the fabric, fit, and overall construction. Look for reviews that mention the material's weight or any specific details about how the item was made. Also, consider the brand reputation - some brands on those platforms consistently get better reviews than others. I can also help you find specific items on the better-reputed sites.",
