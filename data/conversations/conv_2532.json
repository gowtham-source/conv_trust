Lower back pain can stem from many different causes, including muscle strain, poor posture, prolonged sitting, or even stress. Since this has been ongoing for a week, it would be wise to consult with a healthcare professional. They can properly assess your situation and determine the specific cause.

Persistent pain, even without these red flags, should still be evaluated by a doctor.",

These include applying heat or cold packs, taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (follow package instructions carefully), ensuring you are using good posture when sitting or standing, and trying some gentle stretching exercises, but be cautious not to aggravate the pain.
