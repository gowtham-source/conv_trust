You could potentially get a pair of versatile denim shorts (around $20-$30), a few basic t-shirts in neutral colors ($10-$15 each), a lightweight button-down shirt that can be worn open or closed ($20-$30), and a simple sundress ($30-$40). That leaves room for some accessories like a belt or jewelry, or an extra shirt. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?",
