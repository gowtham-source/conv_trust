You then apply layers of joint compound over the patch, extending beyond its edges. It's important to apply thin coats, letting each dry and sanding between coats for a smooth finish. The shape of the hole doesn't matter as much with a mesh patch as long as the patch covers it completely. With careful application and sanding, the repair should be virtually invisible after painting.",
