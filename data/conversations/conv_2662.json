However, providing the *precise* cutoff time and date without linking to the booking platform where the rate is offered is a limitation. These specific terms can sometimes vary slightly based on the provider or package. While it's almost certainly free cancellation up to a point before check-in, for the absolute, legally binding details like the exact cutoff hour, I strongly recommend confirming on the final booking page summary before completing the reservation. I can confirm it is listed as Free Cancellation in the general rate details I access.",
