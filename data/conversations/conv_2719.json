For fields like data analysis or creative roles, you'd typically need to build a portfolio or demonstrate skills through self-study, online courses (like Coursera, Udemy), personal projects, or potentially volunteer work or internships, even entry-level ones. Networking in the target field is also crucial. It requires significant effort and a strategic approach to skill-building and proving your capability outside of traditional work history. It's a marathon, not a sprint, and requires persistence.",
