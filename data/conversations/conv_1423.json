Based on the available data, all three bands blend elements of post-punk, art rock, and indie rock. They all use electric guitars, bass, and drums as core instruments, although Wet Leg tends to be more pop-oriented and less complex in their arrangement. Black Country, New Road, employs violins and saxophone more extensively, which gives their sound a unique twist.",
