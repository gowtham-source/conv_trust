The only thing I sort of like is organizing things, but that's barely a skill. The problem is, I have a degree in a field I don't want to work in anymore, and zero experience in anything else. How is someone like me supposed to realistically pivot without going back to school for years or taking a massive pay cut that I can't afford? It feels impossible.",

      "utterance": "That's a very common and valid concern. Pivoting careers without extensive new education or financial hardship is challenging, but often achievable through strategic steps. It's not always about starting completely from scratch. We could look at identifying transferable skills from your administrative background – like your organizational skills, attention to detail, or communication abilities – and see how they might apply to entry-level roles in related or slightly different fields. Exploring industries that value those skills, considering certifications or short courses instead of full degrees, or seeking roles that blend administrative tasks with exposure to a new area might be pathways. It requires careful planning and often starting with smaller steps.",
