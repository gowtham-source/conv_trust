While it can be tricky, focusing on fabric content (looking for cotton blends, sturdy synthetics, or materials with some weight), checking seams and construction details, and reading customer reviews can help. Some budget-friendly brands do offer better quality basics than others. It requires a bit more scrutiny, but it's not impossible to find durable pieces within a lower price range. Focusing on classic styles also helps, as they tend to be better made even at lower price points.",
