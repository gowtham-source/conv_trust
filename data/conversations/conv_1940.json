To give you the best recommendations, could you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for? For example, are you looking for sneakers, boots, or something else? Also, do you have a budget in mind?",

      "utterance": "Okay, sneakers under $150. Veja is a good bet, as some of their styles are within that price range. Their design philosophy leans heavily towards minimalist aesthetics, focusing on clean lines, sustainable materials, and a lack of excessive branding. Allbirds is similar, and the 'minimalist' definition extends to their single-material uppers and lack of fussy details. Common Projects, while often pricier, also exemplifies minimalism in their clean design. Other options could include some styles from Greats or even Adidas or Nike if you search for specific minimalist-style models. The minimalist design makes them versatile and easy to pair with different outfits. However, what specific minimalist designs stand out and define the style is a matter of opinion. For example, should a minimalist shoe have any branding? What about the sole, should it be chunky or sleek? Ultimately, the 'minimalist' style is quite a wide area. I can provide you with more specific product suggestions if you'd like, based on brands and aesthetics!",
