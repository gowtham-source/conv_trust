You can often find excellent deals on older models that are built to last. Alternatively, look at the HP Envy x360 series if you can find one on sale - these offer slightly better build quality than the regular Pavilion.",

Check the vendor's return policy as well. Look for certifications like 'Certified Refurbished' which indicate the device has undergone thorough testing and repairs.",

      "utterance": "That's a complex question with no simple answer. Generally, extending the lifespan of an existing device (through refurbishment) is considered more environmentally friendly than manufacturing a new one. The production of new electronics is resource-intensive and creates a significant carbon footprint. However, older devices may be less energy-efficient during use. There are studies that try to quantify this, but the results depend heavily on factors like the specific models being compared, usage patterns, and end-of-life recycling practices. I can point you to some research papers on lifecycle assessments of electronics if you'd like to delve deeper.",
