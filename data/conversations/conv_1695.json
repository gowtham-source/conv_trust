Many stores offer free returns. Additionally, look for user reviews specifically mentioning sizing; this can give you a good sense of whether a particular shoe runs true to size, small, or large. I apologize I couldn't be more helpful on that front. Hopefully, the return policies of the stores will help! Would you like me to look up return policies of some retailers for the shoes I recommended?",
