Airlines typically offer different fare classes; standard fares have strict change/cancellation penalties, while 'flexible' or 'business' class tickets offer more leeway but come at a significantly higher price point. Travel insurance is another option to cover certain unforeseen events causing cancellation, but it usually requires a specific reason like illness.",
