Airlines typically offer different fare classes; standard fares have strict change/cancellation penalties, while 'flexible' or 'business' class tickets offer more leeway but come at a significantly higher price point. Travel insurance is another option to cover certain unforeseen events causing cancellation, but it usually requires a specific reason like illness.",

Regarding alternative transport like trains or potentially even driving, my capabilities are primarily focused on air travel booking. I can certainly search for flights again with slightly different dates if you'd like, but I wouldn't be the best resource for planning international rail or road trips.",
