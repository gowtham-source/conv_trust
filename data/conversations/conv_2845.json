It's highly improbable that a single code like 99214 would be invalid for only one specific date without widespread communication. Given the P12 code and the context, it's possible this relates to a specific payer edit rule or a system configuration error on their end regarding that particular CPT for that timeframe. I recommend checking HealthPlan XYZ's provider portal for any recent bulletins or contacting their provider services directly to inquire about denial code P12 specifically related to 99214 around that date range.",
