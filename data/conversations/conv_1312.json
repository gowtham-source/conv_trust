      "utterance": "Based on that information, and after reviewing recent customer reviews and running shoe trends, I'd recommend checking out the Hoka Clifton 9, the New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v13, and the Brooks Glycerin 20. All three are known for excellent cushioning and are popular choices for neutral runners. They also tend to have a good overall rating based on customer reviews. However, I'm seeing mixed results on the Glycerin 20's durability and it's the most expensive of the three. The Hoka Clifton 9's are trending as having a shorter lifespan, and the New Balance 1080v13 seems to be the most durable. Considering your weekly mileage, which of these factors, (price, cushioning, durability) are you most concerned about? Can I help you find some retailers that have them in stock, or would you like me to filter them by price range?",
