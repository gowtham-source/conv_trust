The 'urban fee' covers amenities like high-speed internet, access to the fitness center, local phone calls, and sometimes includes things like daily bottled water or a small food & beverage credit. However, policies vary, and not all amenities might be used or valued by every guest. Typically, it's mandatory. I can check the exact amount for your dates and also see if there's any possibility of waiving it, though it's unlikely. Would you like me to investigate that further, or explore hotels without such fees?",
