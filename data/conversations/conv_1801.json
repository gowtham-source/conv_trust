For house, you might enjoy artists like Disclosure, Gorgon City, and Purple Disco Machine. For techno, try Richie Hawtin, Amelie Lens, and Nina Kraviz. Would you like me to provide links to their music on Spotify or Apple Music?",

Based on your description, I would recommend checking out artists like: *  KiNK (Known for his live sets and unique approach to production) *  \u00c2me (Their more experimental work leans into the techno side, while their house sensibilities are still present) *  Floating Points (While often described as electronic music in general, he does blend house and techno elements). I hope this helps you with your musical journey!",
