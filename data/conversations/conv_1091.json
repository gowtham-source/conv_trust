Use a rubber grout float to press the grout firmly into the joints, working diagonally across the tiles. Remove excess grout with the float, then use a damp sponge to clean the tile surface, rinsing the sponge frequently. Avoid over-wetting the grout. Curing is also vital - mist the grout lightly with water for several days to prevent it from drying too quickly, which can cause cracking.",
