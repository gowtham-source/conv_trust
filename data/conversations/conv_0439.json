Airlines are generally not required to compensate passengers for consequential damages resulting from delays, such as missed meetings. However, many airlines have their own policies and may offer compensation in the form of vouchers or rebooking options depending on the specific circumstances and the length of the delay. It's best to check United's specific policies on their website or contact their customer service directly for more information on their policy. Now, back to those standard economy flights...",
