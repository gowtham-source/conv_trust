While I don't have a direct cancellation list feature, I can search for the earliest available appointments and also check surrounding dates if you like. Unfortunately, appointment flexibility outside of scheduled slots is not something I can directly arrange; that would require speaking with the clinic staff or Dr. Vance's office directly. The next earliest opening I see with Dr. Vance is on Friday, two weeks from now, at 10:00 AM. Would you like me to book that, or should I look for other options?",
