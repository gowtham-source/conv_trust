You can often find basic tees, jeans, and even dresses for under $20 each. For the nicer outfit, look for sales or outlet stores. A simple black dress or a nice blouse with dress pants can be versatile and affordable. Would you like me to suggest some specific items to look for at those stores?",

Specific items: A-line denim skirt, basic crew neck tee (various colors), comfortable sneakers, and a cardigan. For the nicer outfit: black sheath dress (check for sales!), simple gold necklace, and basic black flats. As for ethical and sustainable options within that budget, it's a challenge, but buying secondhand is your best bet. Look for higher-quality brands at thrift stores that will last longer, reducing the need to buy new clothes as often.",

For example, a navy cardigan can be worn with a variety of tops and bottoms. Avoid overly bright or trendy colors that might not be versatile or last beyond a single season.",

Tailoring can also make a big difference, even if it's just hemming pants. Focus on classic silhouettes and good quality fabrics (even if they're secondhand) that will hold their shape. Finally, accessorize! A simple scarf, necklace, or belt can elevate any outfit, no matter how basic.",
