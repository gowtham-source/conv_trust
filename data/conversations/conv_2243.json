Identify the keywords and skills that the companies are looking for, and then highlight your experience and accomplishments that directly align with those requirements. Focus on quantifiable achievements whenever possible â€“ things like 'Increased project efficiency by 15%' or 'Managed a budget of $X.' For roles more than 10 years old, you can generally shorten the descriptions, focusing on titles and key responsibilities. Let me know if you want help with keyword extraction from a specific job posting.",
