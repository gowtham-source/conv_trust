Then, focus on understanding the endpoints (URLs) and the expected data formats (e.g., JSON). Use the API documentation in tandem with the example code to get a good understanding. Finally, use 'curl' or a similar tool to test the API endpoints to see the result. Do you want me to find some sample API calls for those APIs? And a tool for testing?",

React, Angular, and Vue.js are very popular, but might have a steeper learning curve if you're not familiar with them. If you need something faster, consider using a UI framework such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, as they offer pre-built components.
