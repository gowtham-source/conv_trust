There should be shut-off valves under the sink. Then, gather your tools: adjustable wrench, screwdrivers, basin wrench (helpful for hard-to-reach nuts), and a bucket to catch any remaining water. Would you like me to elaborate on the steps?",

      "utterance": "That's a valid concern! If you break a pipe, immediately turn off the main water supply to your house (usually found near your water meter). Then, you'll need to either repair the pipe yourself (using a pipe cutter, couplings, and solder/glue, depending on the pipe type) or call a plumber. A plumber is generally recommended for pipe repairs if you're not familiar with plumbing. Be sure to have a bucket and towels ready for any water leaks. Always ensure to wear the appropriate safety gear like eye protection while working. Unfortunately, I can't directly provide instructions to repair a pipe, but there are plenty of DIY guides available online. Good luck!",
