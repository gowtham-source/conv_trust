While you could factor out an x^2, it's generally not necessary unless the problem specifically asks you to simplify. As for when to use the product rule versus the chain rule: Use the product rule when you are taking the derivative of two functions *multiplied together*. Use the chain rule when you are taking the derivative of a *composite function*, meaning a function inside another function, like sin(x^2). Does that distinction help?",
