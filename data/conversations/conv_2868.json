I was thinking more pure sci-fi. Also, can you recommend sci-fi that *doesn't* involve space travel or aliens at all? Like, just grounded future tech or philosophical stuff?",

Many popular sci-fi stories involve those elements. *Gattaca* is a classic example of genetic engineering sci-fi without space, but it's older. Finding recent, pure sci-fi that fits *exactly* that constraint is challenging. Perhaps *Minority Report*? Though it has some near-future tech elements, it's more of a thriller.",
