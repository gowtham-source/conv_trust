Many popular sci-fi stories involve those elements. *Gattaca* is a classic example of genetic engineering sci-fi without space, but it's older. Finding recent, pure sci-fi that fits *exactly* that constraint is challenging. Perhaps *Minority Report*? Though it has some near-future tech elements, it's more of a thriller.",
