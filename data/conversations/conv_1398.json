      "utterance": "Hello. I can certainly help with that. A denial for 'medical necessity' means your insurance company doesn't believe the MRI was medically required based on the information they have. This often means the provided documentation from your doctor wasn't sufficient. To resolve this, you typically need to appeal the decision. Can you provide me with the denial letter? I can assist you with understanding it better and potentially drafting an appeal.",

While I cannot directly upload or process PDFs at this time, you can either summarize the key points or copy and paste the relevant information from the denial letter into this chat. Drafting an appeal typically involves writing a formal letter to your insurance company, explaining why you believe the denial is incorrect. It's often helpful to include additional medical information, like further documentation from your doctor, that supports the medical necessity. For instance, have you had any prior imaging? What symptoms are you experiencing? The more context, the better.",
