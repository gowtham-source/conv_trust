      "utterance": "That's a really insightful question! Generally, it's difficult to fully protect an idea during a hackathon. Most hackathons operate under the assumption that projects will be shared. However, you can document your work thoroughly (timestamped commits, detailed notes) and consider open-sourcing your project under a license like MIT or Apache 2.0 *after* the hackathon concludes. This gives you attribution and control over how others use it. You could also explore the possibility of filing a provisional patent application, but that involves costs and legal considerations. Focus on execution and showcasing your skills first, and address IP concerns later if the project has significant commercial potential.",
