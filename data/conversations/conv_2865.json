While I cannot determine if your specific symptoms are 'normal' without a medical evaluation, it is important to monitor them. If your symptoms persist, worsen, or if you experience any new concerning symptoms, it is strongly recommended to consult a qualified healthcare professional. They can properly assess your situation.",

They are equipped to handle a wide range of health issues and can refer you to a specialist if needed. When you see the doctor, be prepared to describe your symptoms in detail: when they started, how long they've lasted, their severity, what makes them better or worse, and any other symptoms you might have, even if they seem unrelated.
