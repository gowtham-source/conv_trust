A good starting point is understanding your investment goals, your time horizon (how long you plan to invest), and your risk tolerance. Would you like to start by discussing what you hope to achieve through investing, like retirement or a down payment?",

Yes, you would typically open an investment account with a brokerage firm. ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) trade like stocks throughout the day, while mutual funds are bought and sold based on their end-of-day price. Many platforms offer simple ways to buy these diversified funds, often through fractional shares or automated investment plans, so you don't necessarily need to pick individual stocks. We can explore setting up a basic diversified portfolio using low-cost index funds.",
