      "utterance": "Hello! That's a great goal. For a 'smart casual' style, you have several excellent options. Popular choices include loafers, driving mocs, chukka boots, desert boots, and stylish leather sneakers (often in darker colors or clean designs). Depending on the specific outfit, even some well-maintained boat shoes can work. Do any of those categories sound interesting?",

      "utterance": "That's a fair question. The difference often lies in the design and material. 'Smart casual' leather sneakers typically have a minimalist design, a clean silhouette, and are made from higher quality leather or suede. They lack the athletic features and bulky soles of running or sports-specific sneakers, making them look more refined and suitable for pairing with chinos, dark wash jeans, or even tailored trousers.",

I need shoes that work for that but could *also* pair reasonably well with dark jeans and a casual blazer. And, just to make it difficult, I live somewhere with unpredictable weather, so ideally something that isn't ruined by a little rain, but also isn't super hot. This is so frustrating!",

      "utterance": "I understand the frustration with finding versatile shoes for varied weather! For dark chinos, button-down shirts, and the potential for dark jeans/blazer, while considering unpredictable weather, I would lean towards a leather loafer with a sturdy sole or perhaps a plain-toe leather derby shoe. Both can bridge the gap between smart and casual outfits. Leather offers some water resistance, and you can apply protective sprays. While boots like Chukkas fit the style, they might be warmer than you'd prefer. Does a durable leather option like a loafer or derby seem like a potential fit for your needs?",
