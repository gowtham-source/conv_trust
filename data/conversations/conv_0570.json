      "utterance": "That's a valid concern. It's difficult to provide a precise, universally accepted statistic, as failure rates depend heavily on the specific model, the refurbishment process, and the seller. However, reputable refurbishers often offer warranties, which can mitigate the risk. Finding a reliable study comparing failure rates between new and refurbished laptops is challenging, as data is often proprietary. You can search for product reliability reports from companies like SquareTrade (now Allstate Protection Plans), though their focus is usually on general electronic device reliability rather than specific refurbishment comparisons. Reading customer reviews of specific refurbished models can also provide insights.",
