Typically, at this price point, you'll see compromises in processing power (expect a less powerful processor like an AMD Ryzen 3 or Intel Celeron/Pentium), less RAM (probably 4-8GB), and potentially smaller or slower storage (maybe an eMMC drive instead of a fast SSD). The screen resolution might also be lower. This isn't necessarily a dealbreaker for your stated use case, but keep these factors in mind.",
