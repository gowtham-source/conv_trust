Based on your preferences, I'd recommend 'The Way of Kings' by Brandon Sanderson (part of *The Stormlight Archive*), 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' by Scott Lynch, and 'The Name of the Wind' by Patrick Rothfuss. They are all highly acclaimed and have those elements you mentioned. Do any of those sound interesting?",

'The Lies of Locke Lamora' is part of a series, but the individual books are more self-contained and generally shorter. Though, if I'm honest, I have a little trouble understanding the current state of that author's writing schedule.",

It has a complete narrative and a wonderful sense of closure. If you're open to something a bit different, 'Uprooted' by Naomi Novik is also fantastic as a single book. Do those sound more appealing?",
