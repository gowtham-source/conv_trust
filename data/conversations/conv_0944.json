Given the bean aversion, I will adjust the plan to prioritize lentils, tofu (often a budget-friendly protein source), eggs, and a variety of seasonal and affordable vegetables like cabbage, carrots, and potatoes. I will also focus on grains like rice and pasta. Please give me a moment to generate a revised meal plan for you.",
