However, it's true that it doesn't have perfect context. For example, the system can see that you bought a 'gaming mouse' and 'mechanical keyboard', which leans it towards the suggestion of better gaming laptops. If you'd like to provide additional preferences, like your intended use (gaming, work, etc.), I can refine the recommendations.
