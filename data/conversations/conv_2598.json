      "utterance": "Hmm, that is unusual if there's no visible set screw under the cap. Some very old or specific models might have a different mechanism, perhaps a bolt underneath the sink holding the cartridge in place, or the screw might be in a less obvious spot like under the spout base. If there's definitely no screw and you suspect corrosion, a gentle application of a penetrating lubricant around the base of the handle might help, letting it sit for a while. However, without seeing it or knowing the model, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. If it's significantly corroded, you might need a specialized handle puller tool, or professional help if you're uncomfortable applying more force.",
