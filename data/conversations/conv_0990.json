As for the type of primer, an oil-based primer is generally best for covering dark colors and stains. However, latex primers are easier to clean up. Since you are using a light gray over a dark red, an oil-based primer is recommended. Ensure that it is fully dried before applying a fresh coat or starting the paint job.",
