This includes calculating your current net worth (assets minus liabilities), estimating your current annual expenses, and projecting your retirement expenses. Then, you can determine how much you'll need to save.  We can create a simple budget and savings plan if you'd like. To start, could you share an approximate range of your current annual income?",

      "utterance": "That's a valid concern. For self-employed individuals, calculating retirement needs involves a bit more nuance. Here's what I suggest: first, calculate an average income over the past 3-5 years, if possible. Second, consider setting up a SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, or a solo 401(k) plan, which offer tax advantages. Third, create a buffer account to deal with potential income fluctuations. Fourth, work with a financial advisor who specializes in self-employment. I know a few, but I am not able to provide specific financial advice. What I *can* do is help you find more information about these retirement plans.",
