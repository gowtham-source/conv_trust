The appeal process involves submitting a letter outlining the reasons for the appeal, accompanied by all supporting medical records. Regarding your chances of success, it is difficult to give a precise number without fully reviewing the details. The success rate varies based on the reason for denial, the quality of the supporting documentation, and the specific insurance plan's policies. However, a well-documented appeal with supporting medical records can often lead to a successful reversal of the denial.",
