It involves factors like your desired retirement age, estimated expenses, inflation rate, and investment returns. We'd need to use some financial modeling tools. The appropriate investments will depend on your risk tolerance and time horizon, but generally a diversified portfolio across stocks, bonds, and possibly real estate is recommended. Due to the current economic uncertainty, a cautious approach is often advisable. I can help you estimate your early retirement number, but I highly recommend consulting with a qualified financial advisor for personalized guidance.",
