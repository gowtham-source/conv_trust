Based on that, I recommend these: White sneakers (think Adidas Stan Smiths or Common Projects), neutral-colored loafers, or simple ballet flats. What do you think of those options?",

For loafers fitting the 'clean girl' aesthetic, I'd suggest looking at brands like Gucci (their Jordaan loafer is a classic, though pricey), Everlane (they offer a more affordable, minimalist option), or Tod's. Look for styles in neutral colors like black, brown, or cream leather. Avoid any with heavy embellishments or chunky soles.",
