A great approach is to brainstorm problems you face daily or observe in your community, then consider how technology could offer a solution. Alternatively, you could explore trending technologies like AI or blockchain and see if any use cases spark your interest. To give you some examples, previous hackathons have seen projects focusing on smart home automation, personalized education platforms, or even sustainable agriculture solutions. Does this help at all?",

How about a system that leverages machine learning to optimize energy consumption in buildings based on real-time occupancy and weather data? Or perhaps a platform that connects local farmers with consumers to reduce food waste and promote local agriculture. Another idea could be a tool that analyzes the carbon footprint of different products and helps consumers make more informed purchasing decisions. It may also be valuable to search through hackathon-specific websites to find what others have built in the past to inspire you.",
