Consider a pair of well-fitting jeans (Target or Old Navy are great options), a few basic t-shirts in neutral colors, a comfortable sweater or cardigan, and maybe a simple dress that can be dressed up or down. Check out clearance sections and consider thrift stores for potential bargains! Does this sound like a good starting point?",
