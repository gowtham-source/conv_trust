For the requested dates, December 20th to December 27th, non-stop options are available primarily through United and American Airlines, with prices per ticket starting around $450-$500. These flights generally depart mid-morning or early afternoon. There are also options with one stop starting from around $380, but these often have less convenient schedules.",

And that's for mid-morning, which is good, but is there *any* chance of finding *anything* non-stop below $400, even if we leave on the 19th or return on the 28th? It just seems incredibly high, almost like the system is only showing the most expensive fares. How can I be sure I'm seeing the absolute best non-stop price available, not just what's easiest to book?",
