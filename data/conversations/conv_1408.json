      "utterance": "Hello! I can definitely help with that. A good starting point is to assess your current financial situation. This includes understanding your income, expenses, debts, and assets. Then, we can estimate your retirement needs, taking into account factors like your desired lifestyle and inflation. Finally, we can explore various investment options. To begin, could you tell me a bit about your current income and any retirement savings you already have?",

But, I'm a bit confused about how to calculate how much I *need* for retirement. It feels like a huge number. Also, I've heard a lot about the '4% rule' but I'm not sure I understand it, or if it's even still relevant.",

      "utterance": "Great, that information is very helpful. Regarding calculating your retirement needs, it is a complex calculation, and the '4% rule' is a decent, but perhaps not perfect, rule of thumb. It suggests you can withdraw 4% of your savings in the first year of retirement, and then adjust that amount each year for inflation. However, the relevance of the 4% rule has been debated recently due to changing market conditions and longer lifespans. For your situation, given your income and current savings, we can create a personalized plan that incorporates your desired retirement age, lifestyle, and risk tolerance. I can help you estimate a more precise savings target, which can then inform how you adjust your investment strategy. Would you like to proceed with that?",
