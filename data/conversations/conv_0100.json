Think about problems you're passionate about solving or skills you want to develop. Also, familiarize yourself with the hackathon's rules and judging criteria. That will help shape your project.",

Many platforms offer free or trial access to machine learning services. Think about simplifying your idea to a minimum viable product (MVP) that demonstrates core functionality within the time limit. It's better to have a functional, smaller project than an incomplete, ambitious one. Does that help?",

Focus on a unique problem space, a creative user interface, or a particularly clever integration of different technologies. Judges often look for projects that demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem, a well-designed solution, and potential for real-world impact. Don't just use the technology; *show* its value.
