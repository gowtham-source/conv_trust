The Anker Soundcore Life Q30 is quite good for its price point, but it might struggle a bit more with things like airplane noise or very loud environments. The difference is noticeable in practice, but the Anker still delivers good performance. The exact difference is hard to quantify, but Bose is the superior performer.",
