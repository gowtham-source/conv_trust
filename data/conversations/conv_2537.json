I'm trying to keep the cost reasonable, but I *really* don't want a flight that leaves before 8 AM or arrives after 9 PM. Oh, and can you tell me which airlines on that route have the best on-time performance history? I've had terrible delays lately and I'm frankly a bit fed up.",

Searching for flights from London Heathrow to Rome for October 18th to 25th, prioritizing reasonable cost and avoiding early morning departures or late evening arrivals is certainly achievable. Regarding on-time performance, while I can show you typical flight schedules, specific historical punctuality data for individual routes and airlines isn't always something I have readily available in a comparative format during the initial search. I recommend checking individual airline websites or dedicated flight tracking services for the most detailed performance statistics.",
