Finding hotels under $300 a night in Midtown Manhattan with free breakfast and very close proximity to Times Square for those dates can be challenging. My search results indicate limited availability meeting *all* those specific criteria simultaneously within that budget. However, I can show you options that are either slightly over $300 with free breakfast and close to Times Square, or under $300 but might require a slightly longer walk or not include free breakfast.
