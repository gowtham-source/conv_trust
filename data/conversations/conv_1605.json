Focus on demonstrating equivalent skills or relevant experiences. You can also address the discrepancy in your cover letter, emphasizing your eagerness to learn and how your existing skills make you a good fit. Itâ€™s ultimately up to you, but it's often worth applying if you meet a significant portion of the requirements and believe you'd be a good fit.",
