It's a delicious noodle dish with a hint of sweetness that balances the heat. Alternatively, you could try Green Curry with chicken, also at a medium spice level. Would you like me to check if any restaurants nearby offer those dishes?",

      "utterance": "I understand. Since you're allergic to coconut milk, Green Curry is definitely not a good choice. A better option would be Pad Kra Pao (Thai Basil Stir-fry). It's typically made with your choice of protein (chicken, pork, tofu, etc.) and Thai basil, chilies, garlic, and soy sauce. It's flavorful and spicy but doesn't contain coconut milk. I would recommend confirming with the restaurant that there is no coconut oil used. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in, or should I explore other options?",
