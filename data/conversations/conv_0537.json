It originally referred to bands releasing music independently, but now it's more of a genre label characterized by specific sonic qualities (lo-fi production, jangly guitars, unconventional song structures), lyrical themes (introspection, social commentary), and a certain aesthetic. My algorithms analyze these factors, along with metadata and user reviews, to categorize artists. It's not perfect, and genre boundaries are always blurred, but that's the general process. I hope that helps!",
