Since you've already tried unplugging and replugging, could you please try restarting your home router? Sometimes network issues can prevent the plug from communicating properly. Please restart your router and then try the smart plug again. Let me know if the light changes.",

While a solid red light can indicate a 'device error', network fluctuations can sometimes trigger this state if the plug loses its connection unexpectedly. Restarting the router is a common step to refresh the network and allow devices to re-establish connections cleanly. However, if you've already tried that and it didn't resolve the issue, it may indicate a more specific device problem or a persistent network configuration conflict. Let's try a factory reset on the smart plug itself. This will clear its settings and allow you to set it up again as new. Are you comfortable trying a factory reset?",
