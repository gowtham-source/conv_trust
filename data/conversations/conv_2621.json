While I can't directly diagnose a system glitch, 'Authorization Missing/Invalid' denials can occur for several reasons even with a valid authorization: the authorization wasn't linked correctly to the claim, the specific CPT code on the claim wasn't *explicitly* included on the authorization, the date range on the claim didn't perfectly match the authorization period, or there might be a lag in the payer's system updating. Sometimes submitting the authorization number on the claim isn't enough; the payer's system needs to see it linked internally.",
