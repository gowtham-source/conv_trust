However, a good starting point is to carefully analyze the job description itself. Highlight the skills, responsibilities, and qualifications they emphasize. These are likely the keywords the ATS will be looking for. You can also research industry-standard project management keywords and certifications like PMP, Agile, and Scrum to see if they align with the role and your experience. LinkedIn is also a helpful resource to review profiles of people in similar roles at the target company.",
