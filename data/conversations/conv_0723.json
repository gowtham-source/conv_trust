To give you the best recommendations, could you tell me a bit more about your style preferences and what kind of items you're looking for? For example, are you looking for everyday wear, work attire, or something for special occasions? Also, what is your general size?",

A possible combination could be: A pair of black skinny jeans from Target ($25), a white t-shirt from Old Navy ($10), a gray sweater from H&M ($30) and an olive green jacket from Target ($40). This would give you a solid foundation for your wardrobe at just over $100. Would you like additional options, or a deeper dive into other items?",

Search for brands such as: Adidas, Converse or Vans, they often offer affordable sneakers or casual shoes that will last a decent amount of time. Also, I recommend looking for sales on higher quality brands or off-season options. Remember to read reviews to get a better sense of durability. Also, many retailers will provide a discount if you open a store credit card.",
