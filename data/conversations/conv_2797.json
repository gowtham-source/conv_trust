Many single-handle faucets do have a small decorative cap, sometimes colored blue/red for hot/cold, that you can gently pry off with a utility knife or small flathead screwdriver. Regarding the mechanism type, it's often difficult to tell definitively without partial disassembly or knowing the specific brand/model. However, most newer single-handle faucets use a cartridge system, while older or certain brands might use a ball assembly. Knowing the brand could help identify the part needed.",
