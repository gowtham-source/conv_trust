Second, consider prioritizing higher-interest debt, like credit cards. Pay them off as aggressively as possible to reduce interest. Third, try to contribute enough to your 401k to get any employer matching contributions. That's free money! Finally, look at your overall financial plan and determine the trade offs to best meet your goals.",
