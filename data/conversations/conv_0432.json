Dull, throbbing headaches combined with fatigue can indicate several possibilities, ranging from simple dehydration or stress to more complex conditions like tension headaches or even, in rare cases, underlying medical issues. I suggest trying to increase your water intake and ensuring you are getting sufficient rest for the next few days. If the symptoms persist or worsen, it would be beneficial to consult with a medical professional for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?",

Red flags to watch out for include sudden, severe headaches that are different from your usual headaches, headaches accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, numbness, seizures, or difficulty speaking. If you experience any of these, seek immediate medical attention. Also, a headache that progressively worsens over days or weeks despite self-care measures warrants a doctor's visit. I hope this clarification is more helpful.",
