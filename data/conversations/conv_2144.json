For a $100 budget and a preference for less meat, peanut allergy and including cheap ingredients, I'd recommend focusing on meals with beans, lentils, and eggs as primary protein sources. Some options are: Lentil soup, bean and cheese burritos, and frittatas. Do you have access to a kitchen, including pots, pans, and basic cooking utensils?",

Generating a fully comprehensive shopping list with live prices, accounting for all cooking basics, and tailored to your local area is beyond my current capabilities. However, I can suggest a sample shopping list focusing on value: Lentils, dried beans, eggs, rice, pasta, onions, garlic, frozen vegetables (mixed), canned tomatoes, and a small amount of cooking oil. Prices will vary, so please check your local grocery store's website or flyer. You can often find spices at discount stores.",
