Regarding your question about the car's value, if the repair estimate exceeds the vehicle's actual cash value, it may be deemed a total loss. In that scenario, we would offer you a settlement based on the vehicle's pre-accident market value, minus your deductible. We use a variety of sources to determine fair market value.",
