Look for keywords like \"Spotify API challenge\" or check if Spotify is listed as a sponsor. Sponsors often have related challenges. Alternatively, even if it's not explicitly mentioned, you can likely still use the Spotify API if the hackathon rules don't restrict API usage. Just make sure to comply with Spotify's API terms of service.",

A well-defined rubric (e.g., innovation, technical difficulty, impact, presentation) is a good sign. Also, check the background of the judges if that information is available. A diverse panel of judges with expertise relevant to the hackathon's themes can help mitigate bias. Unfortunately, there's no perfect system, but transparency is key. You can also try looking for reviews of past events organized by the same organizers.",
