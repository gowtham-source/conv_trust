Prioritize getting a working prototype with a clear value proposition. Remember to document everything! Consider using platforms like Kaggle for tutorials and datasets.

Here's a structured approach to problem-solving during a hackathon: 1) Clearly define the problem. 2) Break it down into smaller, manageable parts. 3) Google extensively (Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.). 4) Consult documentation. 5) If you're still stuck, ask for help! Look for mentors or organizers. Don't be afraid to pivot your approach or simplify if necessary. Prioritize building *something* over perfection. Also, consider using a well-documented library whenever possible, instead of writing your own function.",
