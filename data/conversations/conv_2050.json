      "utterance": "Excellent question! That is a good test of your understanding. Using the mole ratio from the balanced equation (2 moles H2O / 1 mole O2), you would multiply the given moles of O2 (5 moles) by this ratio:  5 moles O2 * (2 moles H2O / 1 mole O2) = 10 moles H2O. You would produce 10 moles of water. Does that make sense?",
