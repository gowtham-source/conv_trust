It stands out because of its incredibly detailed historical setting (19th-century England), its sophisticated prose, and the way it seamlessly weaves magic into a realistic portrayal of the era. It feels less like a typical fantasy novel and more like an alternate history with deep literary merit. The scale and ambition of the world-building are simply unmatched, in my opinion.",
