The 'Service Upgrade Fee' typically applies when a user opts into a feature or service tier that is not part of their standard package. While automatic upgrades without consent should not occur, sometimes trial periods or specific feature accesses can trigger a charge if not cancelled within a certain timeframe. I can see the charge posted on [Date]. To determine the exact cause and explore options like a credit, I would need to initiate a formal billing investigation which can take 3-5 business days. Would you like me to start that process?",
