The appeal process generally involves submitting a written request, along with any supporting documentation, such as medical records or evidence showing pre-authorization was attempted. To start the appeal, you will need to submit the claim information, reason for denial, and your arguments for why the denial should be reversed. While I cannot guarantee a specific success rate, typically, appeals are approved at a rate of about 20%. Specific instructions, including the appeal form and mailing address, can be found on our website under 'Appeals.' Please be sure to review your plan documents for the precise appeal timeframes, as they vary by plan. Would you like me to help you find the relevant information on our website?",
