For a casual dress, ballet flats, sandals, or low-heeled espadrilles would work well. Does any of that sound interesting so far?",

Veja is a popular choice known for using organic cotton, wild rubber from the Amazon, and recycled materials. Allbirds is another excellent option, specializing in shoes made from sustainable materials like merino wool and eucalyptus tree fiber. Rothy's makes flats from recycled plastic bottles. It's worth researching each brand's specific practices to see which aligns best with your values. Please note, I am still under development and information about current environmental practices may vary.",
