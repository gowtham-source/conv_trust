Grease and grime from the kitchen can prevent paint from adhering properly. Use a degreaser cleaner specifically designed for cabinets, rinse well, and let them dry completely. Then, you can proceed to removing hardware and light sanding.",

      "utterance": "Great job on the cleaning! For stained cabinets you're painting, you don't typically need to sand down to bare wood. The goal is to scuff the surface to create 'tooth' for the primer to grip onto. Start with a medium-grit sandpaper, like 150-grit, to lightly rough up the finish, then you might follow with a finer grit, say 220, for a smoother feel before priming. Just ensure the surface is dull, not glossy.",
