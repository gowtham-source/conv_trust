Regarding temperature, achieving an optimal brewing temperature between 195°F and 205°F is key for flavor extraction. The Bonavita Connoisseur is specifically designed to maintain a consistent brewing temperature within this range throughout the brew cycle, often resulting in a hotter cup compared to more basic models.

Within the under $150 range focused on temperature, the Bonavita Connoisseur is often considered a top pick. Alternatively, some users find adding a simple mug warmer helps keep their coffee hot after brewing with other machines.
