These can weaken your immune system and lead to fatigue. I recommend prioritizing a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Also, aim for at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Even small changes can make a big difference. Would you like some resources for improving your diet or sleep hygiene?",

While I can offer general health information, I am not a medical professional. It's always best to discuss your symptoms with your doctor and request specific tests, such as a vitamin D level check, if you feel they are necessary. Your doctor is in the best position to assess your overall health and provide personalized recommendations. If you're not satisfied with your current doctor's response, you could consider a second opinion.",
