      "utterance": "I understand your frustration. Generally, property owners are responsible for maintaining their trees in a reasonably safe condition. If the tree was healthy and the storm was unusually severe, it might indeed be considered an 'act of God,' absolving your neighbor of liability. However, if the tree was diseased, rotting, or otherwise presented a known hazard *before* the storm, your neighbor may be responsible for the damages. Do you have any evidence suggesting the tree was in poor condition prior to falling?",

The fact that you notified him strengthens your claim that he had knowledge of the tree's hazardous condition. You should document when you spoke to him and what was said. It might be helpful to take photos of the fallen tree and the damage. Could you provide details on the state law in your area regarding tree liabilities?",
