To address your salary concerns, let's research industry standards for similar roles. I can help you find resources like salary surveys. Additionally, focusing on transferable skills is key. Even if you don't have the exact same experience as someone with ten years, your problem-solving skills, communication, and project management experience could still be highly relevant. Let's also explore resume writing and interview preparation to highlight your strengths.",
