      "utterance": "Ah, the classic estimation or 'Fermi' problems! While less common in pure technical rounds, they can appear. The key isn't the exact number, but demonstrating your ability to break down a seemingly impossible problem into smaller, manageable pieces, make reasonable assumptions, and perform estimations using rough calculations. For estimating grains of sand, you'd think about estimating the beach's volume (length x width x depth), estimating the volume of a single grain of sand, and then dividing. Explain your assumptions clearly. Focus on showing your structured thinking and comfort with uncertainty, rather than finding the 'right' answer. For system design, we can focus on common patterns and practice designing scalable systems.",
