While improvements and patches have addressed some of the initial problems, some players still report instances of AI behaving somewhat predictably or getting stuck. However, many find that the immersion and realism offered by the rest of the game outweighs these occasional shortcomings. I recommend looking at recent gameplay videos and reviews specifically addressing the AI to see if it's something you can tolerate.",
