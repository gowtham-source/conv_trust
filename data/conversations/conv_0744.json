However, there are exceptions, such as if a contract stipulates otherwise or if a statute allows for fee-shifting. It depends on the specific laws in your state and the details of your case. A lawyer can advise you on the likelihood of recovering legal fees if you win. Is there anything else I can help you with today?",
