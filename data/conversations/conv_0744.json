If it was, the damage might be considered an 'act of God,' and you'd be responsible. However, if the tree was diseased or neglected, your neighbor could be liable. Do you know the condition of the tree?",

However, there are exceptions, such as if a contract stipulates otherwise or if a statute allows for fee-shifting. It depends on the specific laws in your state and the details of your case. A lawyer can advise you on the likelihood of recovering legal fees if you win. Is there anything else I can help you with today?",
