Regarding the address change, since the order has shipped, it may be more challenging, but I can try to help. Please give me the new address, and I'll contact the shipping carrier directly to see if they can reroute the package. However, please note that there might be a small fee, and it's not always guaranteed, depending on the stage of the delivery process and the carrier's policies. We will do our best to resolve this for you.",
