Then, brush up on your skills, especially the ones related to your project idea. Also, research common tech stacks used at hackathons and choose one you're comfortable with. Finally, get a good night's sleep beforehand! Let me know if you have any specific areas you'd like me to elaborate on.",

One thing I'm struggling with: the hackathon rules state we can't use any code that already exists as-is; everything needs to be original.
