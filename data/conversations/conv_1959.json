For the tech role, identify the skills that overlap with project management, like leading teams, managing deadlines, or problem-solving. If any details are confidential, you can use general terms like 'managed sensitive projects' or 'oversaw proprietary processes' or 'coordinated with stakeholders'. We can craft more specific wording once you feel ready to share the information.",
