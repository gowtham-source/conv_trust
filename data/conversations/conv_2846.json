If the landlord claims damages that exceed the deposit, they would typically need to provide evidence to support those claims, such as itemized repair bills or before-and-after photos. Your evidence of the property's condition upon your departure would be key in disputing any such claims. While challenging, presenting clear evidence of the state you left the property in is your best approach. For tailored strategy and legal guidance, consulting with a local attorney or legal aid society would be highly beneficial.",
