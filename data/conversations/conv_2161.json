However, for introductory physics problems, we often simplify the model by neglecting it. Doing so allows us to focus on the fundamental principles of projectile motion without introducing the added complexity of air resistance. However, if your assignment includes air resistance, it would be a different calculation entirely. It would involve drag force, which can be quite complicated.
