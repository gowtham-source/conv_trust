Have you ever read anything by Tamsyn Muir? Her *Locked Tomb* series is excellent and has a unique sci-fi fantasy blend. Also, for something more classic, consider *The Priory of the Orange Tree* by Samantha Shannon.",

      "utterance": "That's a good question. *Gideon the Ninth* (the first book in the *Locked Tomb* series) leans more heavily on fantasy initially, with a very gothic atmosphere and necromantic magic. The sci-fi elements become more prominent as the story progresses, but they're cleverly integrated and enhance the world-building, rather than dominating the narrative. Think of it as fantasy with a sci-fi twist, rather than the other way around. There is also a sequel, *Harrow the Ninth* and a third book, *Nona the Ninth*. I'd recommend giving it a try if you are looking for something different!",
