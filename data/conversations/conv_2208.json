Unlike the others, it's primarily a detective RPG focused on dialogue, investigation, and thought-based decision-making, with very minimal combat. Think of it as a deep dive into a character's psyche, with incredible replayability. Gameplay is very different than Horizon or XCOM 2; combat is a minor factor, and it's very heavily story-driven. It stands out due to its narrative depth and distinct style. Would you like more detail on specific aspects? ",
