      "utterance": "That's a great question. Stability is a really important factor. While the Clifton 9 isn't marketed as a stability shoe, its design is generally considered neutral. People with mild pronation may be fine in them, but if you have a history of knee issues it may be best to try a gait analysis at a specialty running store to determine if you need a more supportive shoe, such as the Brooks Adrenaline GTS. I would definitely recommend trying them on at a local store if possible. Would you like me to provide a list of local running shoe stores in your area?",
