I would suggest you read some reviews because some users have reported issues with this machine's durability.\n\nI can provide links to these products if you'd like. Regarding brand trust, both Mr. Coffee and Cuisinart have a strong reputation. OXO is generally well-regarded, too, despite the mixed user reviews. Please let me know if you want to see any of these models in more detail or have further questions!",
