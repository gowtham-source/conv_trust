The initial implementation was incredibly slow, like taking minutes to generate recommendations for a single user. I spearheaded an effort to profile the code and identified several performance bottlenecks, including inefficient database queries and poorly optimized algorithms. I refactored the queries using indexes and optimized the core algorithm using dynamic programming, which reduced the recommendation generation time to under a second. I also implemented caching to further improve performance. Does that sound like a decent answer?",

Avoid jargon without sufficient context. Finally, what did you learn from the experience?",
