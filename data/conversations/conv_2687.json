      "utterance": "Finding budget-friendly yet durable pieces can be a challenge, I understand your frustration. For warmer weather and your budget, focusing on sales, discount retailers, or even checking online second-hand marketplaces can be effective. Brands like H&M, Zara (during sales), Uniqlo, or even Old Navy often have versatile items like linen-blend pants or cotton tops under $30-$40. A light jacket or cardigan might be the trickiest piece within that budget unless you find a good sale or opt for a simple layering piece like a long-sleeve tee that can double as light coverage. Sometimes exploring outlet stores or checking the 'new arrivals' sections of value retailers can reveal hidden gems before they sell out. Should I start looking for specific items like lightweight trousers and tops?",
