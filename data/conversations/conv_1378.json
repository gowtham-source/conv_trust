First, you'll need to gather your tools: a basin wrench, adjustable wrench, pliers, screwdriver, plumber's tape, a bucket, and a towel. Then, turn off the water supply under the sink (there should be shut-off valves). After that, disconnect the old faucet and water lines. Finally, install the new faucet following the manufacturer's instructions.",

      "utterance": "I understand your frustration; those instructions can be a pain! Essentially, the supply lines (the flexible tubes) have nuts on the ends. You'll screw these nuts onto the threaded inlets on the faucet. The compression fittings are the parts that create the watertight seal. Make sure you use plumber's tape on the threads before tightening the nuts. Tighten them snuggly with an adjustable wrench, but don't overtighten. Overtightening can damage the fittings.",

Ensure all connections are tight but not over-tightened, and double-check for leaks after turning the water back on.
