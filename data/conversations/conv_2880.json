Think about buying a whole chicken or chicken thighs, which are often cheaper per pound. Pasta is very budget-friendly. For veggies, carrots, potatoes, frozen mixed vegetables, and cabbage are usually affordable options. You can plan meals like chicken and pasta, maybe a vegetable soup, or pasta salad.",

      "utterance": "That's a great question about finding current prices. Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time, store-specific price data or sales flyers for every location. You'd typically need to check store websites, apps, or local flyers yourself. However, to stay within budget and vary meals, focus on ingredient multi-tasking. For instance, a large pack of chicken thighs can be used in pasta one night, maybe shredded for tacos or sandwiches another, and some added to soup. Buying staples like rice, dried beans, oats (for breakfast) is cost-effective and they last. Look for sale items on non-perishables or produce that's in season.",

You could make: \n1. **Chicken & Veggie Pasta:** Simple pasta with saut\u00e9ed chicken and mixed frozen veggies in a light sauce.\n2. **Chicken & Vegetable Soup/Stew:** Use some chicken pieces (bones if you have them) for broth, add all the veggies and pasta, or maybe a cheaper grain like rice if you buy that too.\n3. **Cold Pasta Salad:** Use leftover chicken and cooked pasta, mix with the thawed frozen veggies, and a simple vinaigrette (oil/vinegar).\n4. **Chicken & Veggie Stir-fry (simplified):** Saut\u00e9 chicken and veggies, serve over rice or pasta, using a cheap soy sauce or broth base.\n5. **Chicken Sandwiches/Wraps:** Shred leftover chicken, mix with mayo or a cheap sauce, add some veggies for crunch, serve on inexpensive bread or tortillas. \nFocusing on recipes that use similar base ingredients but change the preparation or sauce method is key for variety on a budget.",
