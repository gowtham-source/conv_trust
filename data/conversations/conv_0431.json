I've escalated the tracking on your behalf. As for your question, in the rare event an item is lost in transit, we typically offer a replacement first, assuming the item is still in stock. If a replacement isn't possible or preferred, we'll issue a full refund. We'll keep an eye on your order, and I'll send you an update tomorrow morning.",
