Regarding the Sennheiser HD 350BT, it's also a good option, but based on aggregate user reviews focusing specifically on 'sound quality' and 'value' under $150 at this moment, the others slightly outperformed it in our current recommendation model. Availability and price fluctuations can also affect which specific models are highlighted.",
