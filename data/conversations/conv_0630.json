Then, apply a waterproof membrane like RedGard or Hydro Ban according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pay special attention to corners and seams, using mesh tape for reinforcement. Let it cure fully before tiling. Does that make sense?",

These are generally easier for DIYers as the slope is already built-in. If you prefer a traditional mortar bed, it's more complex and requires precise sloping to ensure proper drainage. For mortar beds, professional installation is often recommended to avoid leaks, but I can provide instructions if you'd like to proceed with that route.",
