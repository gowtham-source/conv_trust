We can practice common behavioral questions, discuss potential product sense scenarios, and refine your resume talking points. Don't worry, feeling nervous is completely normal.

Structure your answer by briefly describing the situation and the outcome. Crucially, spend most of your time explaining *what* you learned from it, how you've changed your approach since, and what specific steps you took or would take differently next time based on that experience. Emphasize the lessons learned and how you applied them moving forward. It's about showing growth, not just listing mistakes.",
