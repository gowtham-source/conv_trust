All offer excellent cushioning and are generally well-regarded for road running. They also offer varying levels of stability for pronation, so you can narrow down your options.",

Our engine currently analyzes user feedback and product specifications, and we are developing features to incorporate gait analysis and foot shape. For now, I'd still recommend the shoes I mentioned based on your criteria, but be sure to read reviews focusing on fit and stability. Consider visiting a local running store where they can assess your gait for a more personalized recommendation, if possible.",
