Our engine currently analyzes user feedback and product specifications, and we are developing features to incorporate gait analysis and foot shape. For now, I'd still recommend the shoes I mentioned based on your criteria, but be sure to read reviews focusing on fit and stability. Consider visiting a local running store where they can assess your gait for a more personalized recommendation, if possible.",
