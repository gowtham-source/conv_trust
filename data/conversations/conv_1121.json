Suede can also add a touch of sophistication and differentiation. Alternatively, perhaps loafers could also fit the bill.

Think about styles with chunkier soles, embellishments like buckles or chains, or even woven textures. They pair well with everything from tailored trousers and a blazer for a smart-casual look, to jeans and a crisp shirt for a more relaxed vibe. You could even wear them with dresses or skirts for a more unexpected and stylish combination. If you wanted to kick it up a notch, you could try horsebit loafers for a nod to Gucci, or even tassel loafers for a bit of flair.",
