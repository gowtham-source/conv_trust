Think about styles with chunkier soles, embellishments like buckles or chains, or even woven textures. They pair well with everything from tailored trousers and a blazer for a smart-casual look, to jeans and a crisp shirt for a more relaxed vibe. You could even wear them with dresses or skirts for a more unexpected and stylish combination. If you wanted to kick it up a notch, you could try horsebit loafers for a nod to Gucci, or even tassel loafers for a bit of flair.",
