For a beginner, I'd recommend focusing on a few key things: familiarize yourself with the tools and technologies you plan to use, try to attend any pre-hackathon workshops, and definitely prioritize sleep and staying hydrated during the event itself. Also, networking is key – don't be afraid to talk to other participants!",

Look for people who seem enthusiastic and have complementary skills to your own – maybe someone good at design if you're a developer, or vice versa. Discuss project ideas openly and try to find a common ground that excites everyone. Setting clear expectations upfront about roles and goals can help prevent issues later.",
