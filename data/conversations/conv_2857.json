Strategy games cover a broad range, but here are a few popular and well-regarded titles across different subgenres:  Civilization VI (turn-based strategy), StarCraft II (real-time strategy), XCOM 2 (tactical turn-based), and Crusader Kings III (grand strategy). Have you played any of these?",

For strategy games with RPG elements, you might consider titles like Divinity: Original Sin 2 (though primarily an RPG, it has deep tactical combat), or perhaps Battle Brothers (a turn-based strategy RPG with mercenary management). Another interesting blend is Wartales, which combines strategy, RPG, and exploration.  Would any of those pique your interest?",
