Factoring is generally faster, but it only works if the quadratic equation can be easily factored into two binomials with integer coefficients. The quadratic formula *always* works, even when factoring is difficult or impossible. A good first step is to try factoring. If you can't find the factors relatively quickly, then switch to the quadratic formula. Does that make sense?",
