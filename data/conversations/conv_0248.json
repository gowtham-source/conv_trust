While 'Ashes of the Singularity' emphasizes massive scale battles with hundreds of units, 'Iron Harvest' focuses on smaller, more tactical engagements with a stronger emphasis on cover and unit positioning. Unit variety is less expansive than 'Ashes,' but each unit has a distinct role. Regarding your second point, the prevalence of RTS games on PC is largely due to the precision offered by a mouse and keyboard, which are generally considered superior for controlling complex unit formations and resource management compared to console controllers.",
