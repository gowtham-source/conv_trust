Based on what you've described, some good options might be: \n\n*   **Leather or suede loafers:** These are comfortable, stylish, and can be dressed up or down.\n*   **Chelsea boots:** Another versatile option that works well with both casual and more formal outfits.\n*   **Clean, minimalist sneakers:** Opt for leather or suede sneakers in neutral colors like white, black, or gray. These can be surprisingly versatile.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these, or perhaps suggest specific brands or models?",

To avoid the 'gym shoe' look, pay attention to the material and color. Opt for leather or suede over synthetic materials, and stick to neutral colors like white, black, grey, or navy. Avoid bright colors, overly sporty designs, or overly thick soles. Pair them with chinos or dark wash jeans and a button-down shirt or a smart sweater for a business casual look.",
