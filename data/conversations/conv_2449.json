      "utterance": "That's a really insightful question. For smart casual leather sneakers, look for minimal design, premium-looking leather (often smooth or tumbled, avoid overtly sporty textures), and simple soles. The lack of visible logos or athletic features is key. As for color, both brown and black work, but brown is often considered slightly more versatile for smart casual as it pairs easily with blues, greens, and earth tones, while black is classic and sharp, great with grey or darker outfits. It really depends on your wardrobe.",
