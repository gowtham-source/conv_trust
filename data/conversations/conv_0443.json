You can often find basic t-shirts and blouses for under $15 each. For jeans, consider looking for sales or discounts at stores like Old Navy or Target. Secondhand stores like ThredUp can also be a goldmine for finding quality jeans at a fraction of the retail price. Focus on neutral colors that can be mixed and matched easily.",

Poshmark and Depop are also great options for buying and selling used clothing, which is a more sustainable choice. You can often find gently used items from brands you like for less than retail.
