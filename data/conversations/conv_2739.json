While systems often attempt to forward claims to secondary insurance, this process can sometimes fail if the primary denial reason (like PR-204) doesn't trigger the correct forwarding mechanism or if the secondary insurance information is missing or incorrect in the system. Eligibility checks provide a snapshot but coverage can be complex. For specific scenarios involving benefit changes or secondary forwarding failures, reviewing the full Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or contacting the payer directly is often necessary.",
