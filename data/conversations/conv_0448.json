Let me look up the configuration for your scrubbing software\u2026 Based on the settings, it seems the rule set related to modifier 25 and code 99214 hasn't been updated since last year.

      "utterance": "That's a very valid point and a common challenge. Most scrubbing software allows for custom exception rules. You would create a rule that checks the payer (Blue Shield in this case) and the specific combination of codes (99214 and 90471) and then bypass the modifier 25 requirement. The exact syntax for these exception rules will depend on your specific software. I recommend checking the software's documentation or contacting their support for the precise configuration steps. Alternatively, some advanced systems offer AI-driven policy analysis that can dynamically update scrubbing rules based on real-time payer policies, but those tend to be more expensive solutions.",
