The 'indie rock' label for Built to Spill comes from a combination of factors: their independent record label history, their guitar-driven sound with unconventional song structures (compared to mainstream rock), and their influence on other bands that are widely considered 'indie.' You're right, genres are subjective, and the algorithm identifies artists based on keywords in reviews and descriptions, similar artist connections, and listening patterns of users who also enjoy indie rock. It's not a perfect system, but it tries to capture the essence of the genre through data analysis. Would you like to hear some popular tracks by Built to Spill?",
