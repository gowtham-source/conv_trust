For a versatile top that works well with jeans and layering, I'd suggest looking for a fitted or semi-fitted long-sleeve t-shirt or a simple crewneck sweater in a neutral color like white, black, grey, or navy. These can be worn alone or layered under a jacket or cardigan. When checking quality in person, look at the seams \u2013 they should be neat and strong \u2013 and feel the fabric; avoid anything overly thin or flimsy if you want it to last. Checking online reviews for specific items can also be helpful regarding durability.",
