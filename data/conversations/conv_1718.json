This includes calculating your net worth, reviewing your income and expenses, and identifying your existing assets and debts. Then, we can estimate your retirement needs and develop a plan to achieve them. Would you like me to walk you through a basic net worth calculation?",

We should also prioritize building a significant emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. Finally, we could explore investment strategies that offer more stability, such as conservative portfolios.
