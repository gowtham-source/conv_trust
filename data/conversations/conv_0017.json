Generally, a breach of contract allows you to seek remedies such as specific performance (forcing the landlord to provide the original unit, if possible) or monetary damages to compensate for your losses (e.g., the difference in rent, moving expenses, temporary housing costs). However, this is general information and not a substitute for personalized advice.",

A court might be hesitant to order something impossible or unsafe. In such cases, the focus shifts to monetary damages. These could cover the difference in rent between what you're now paying and what you *would* have paid for a comparable unit, plus any reasonable expenses incurred due to the breach.",
