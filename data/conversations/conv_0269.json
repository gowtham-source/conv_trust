You can find basic tops for under $20. A lightweight jacket might cost around $40-$50. Look for sales and clearance items to maximize your budget.",

While they might not be the highest quality, if you care for them properly \u2013 washing them inside out in cold water and avoiding the dryer \u2013 you can extend their lifespan.
