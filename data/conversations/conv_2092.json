I understand the basic concept, but I'm stuck on this one: 'A conical water tank with a height of 12 feet and a radius of 4 feet is leaking water at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. How fast is the water level dropping when the water is 6 feet deep?' I'm so confused!",

The volume of a cone is V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h. We can use similar triangles to relate r and h. Can you tell me what the relationship is between r and h in this scenario?",
