While I can certainly provide recommendations based on the artists you like, the nuances between jangle-pop and twee pop are complex and based on a number of factors including instrumentation, lyrical themes, and geographic origin. It would take a full musicology course to properly explain. Based on your existing tastes, I recommend you check out these artists:  *   Fontaines D.C. *   Wallows *   Sports Team.  I hope you find something you like! ",
