It deals with rebuilding civilization after a nuclear war and has moments of both darkness and profound hope. As for your question about defining dystopia, it generally refers to a society characterized by oppressive social control, often disguised as utopian ideals. Common themes include loss of individuality, surveillance, and environmental collapse. It's a complex genre, and you're right, the line between dystopia and other types of speculative fiction can be blurry!",
