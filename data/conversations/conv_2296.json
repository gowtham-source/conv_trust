Another good option is to start with ETFs, which have lower fees and can diversify risk. Consider looking into robo-advisors too. They often have low minimum investment amounts and can help you with portfolio allocation and management. However, be mindful of the fees involved and your personal risk tolerance. You could explore these options more in depth or I can provide additional resources, such as links to specific investment products or websites.",
