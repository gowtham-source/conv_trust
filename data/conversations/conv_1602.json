Also, 'The Outer Worlds' offers a sci-fi experience with a lot of player choice.  If those aren't appealing, can you tell me a bit more about what you *don't* enjoy in a game? That will help me narrow down the suggestions.",

It's a turn-based RPG, which is different from open-world, but it has an incredible story, deep character customization, and excellent combat. The grind is relatively minimal. Another option, though not strictly RPG, is 'Elden Ring'. It's action-oriented, but the exploration and lore are superb.",

      "utterance": "That's a challenging question! 'Elden Ring' is known for its difficulty, yes. However, a lot of that difficulty can be mitigated by exploring the open world, leveling up, and summoning other players or NPCs for assistance. The game rewards patience and strategic thinking more than twitch reflexes. It's not just about being good at button mashing. Consider watching some gameplay videos to get a feel for it before you decide.",
