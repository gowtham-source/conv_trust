While Chromebooks don't natively run the desktop versions of Microsoft Office, you can use the web-based versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint through your Google account. There are also Android versions of these apps available on the Google Play Store. However, if running the full desktop versions is critical, the Acer Aspire 1 or HP Stream 14 running Windows would be better choices, though they might be slightly less powerful overall. I apologize if I didn't make that clearer initially.",

While I can't directly browse used marketplaces for you, I can suggest some models that typically fall within your budget when purchased used. Look for older models of the Dell XPS 13, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, or even Macbook Airs from a few years back. Check sites like eBay or Swappa, and be sure to carefully review the seller's rating and the condition of the laptop before buying. Also, consider the battery health, as that's a common issue with used laptops. Good luck!",
