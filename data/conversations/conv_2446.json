Checking claim status efficiently depends on the payer, but generally, you can use their online provider portal if they offer one, call their automated or live support line with the patient and claim information, or submit an electronic 276 claim status request if your billing software supports it and the payer accepts it.

Without reviewing the full Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) for this denial, it's difficult to give a definitive, specific reason for this particular claim.",
