Instead of focusing purely on the term 'optimization,' let's reframe it by highlighting your *analytical approach* and the *impact* of your data usage, regardless of the complexity of the techniques. Use phrases like 'Utilized performance metrics to refine campaign strategies' or 'Analyzed data trends to inform tactical adjustments.' Provide a concrete example where your data-backed decisions led to a measurable improvement, even if it wasn't a large-scale 'optimization' project. We can craft a sentence that acknowledges your analytical skills and their positive results without overstating your specific optimization expertise.",
