An English Literature degree provides a strong foundation in critical thinking, communication, and analytical skills, which are valuable in many fields. Teaching is a common path, but certainly not the only one. Have you considered careers in writing, editing, publishing, marketing, or even law? We can explore these and other options based on your interests and skills.",

Areas that require creativity, nuanced understanding, original thought, and emotional intelligence \u2013 things like persuasive writing, storytelling, complex analysis, and strategic communication \u2013 still heavily rely on human expertise. In fact, the need for writers who can effectively *use* and *critique* AI-generated content is likely to increase.
