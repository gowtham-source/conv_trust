Regarding your question about new customer verification: Our system uses a combination of factors, including email address, shipping address, billing address, and credit card information to identify potential duplicate accounts. While it's not foolproof, it helps to prevent widespread abuse of the new customer discount. If you believe you are eligible for a new customer discount, please try a different email address and confirm the promotion's details before placing your order.
