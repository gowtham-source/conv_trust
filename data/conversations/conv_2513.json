I really liked 'Horizon Forbidden West' recently because of the open world exploration and combat, but I'm not necessarily looking for *exactly* that. More like, an ARPG with a really good story and satisfying progression, but definitely not soulslike difficulty. Any other ideas?",

Something like Dragon Age: Inquisition maybe, but newer or just different?",

One title that has some similarities, focusing on story, action combat, and a companion system, is 'GreedFall'. It offers an action RPG experience with choices and companions, though the party control isn't as deep as Dragon Age. It might be worth looking into.",
