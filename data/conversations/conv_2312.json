Hmm, for something older, perhaps 'Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition'? It has updated graphics, but the core gameplay is still the same. It should run well on most systems. Another option is 'StarCraft: Brood War' if you're into real-time strategy. I also found 'XCOM: Enemy Unknown', which is a turn based strategy game with lower requirements. Sorry for the delay on that one!",
