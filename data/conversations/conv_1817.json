They're versatile and affordable.\n*   **Leather sneakers:** brands like Adidas or Nike have some nice options that can be dressed up a bit. \n*   **Suede or leather Chukka boots:** These are a great choice for something a little different but still casual. \n\nDoes that sound like what you're looking for?",

      "utterance": "Great question! Suede is a type of leather with a napped finish, making it softer and more casual looking. Leather is generally more durable and can look more polished. As for the heat, yes, leather boots can be warm in the summer, but lighter-colored leather or suede boots tend to be a bit cooler. You could also consider options with breathable linings or perforations. Do you want me to provide some specific brands or models?",
