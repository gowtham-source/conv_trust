They're versatile and affordable.\n*   **Leather sneakers:** brands like Adidas or Nike have some nice options that can be dressed up a bit. \n*   **Suede or leather Chukka boots:** These are a great choice for something a little different but still casual. \n\nDoes that sound like what you're looking for?",

As for the heat, yes, leather boots can be warm in the summer, but lighter-colored leather or suede boots tend to be a bit cooler. You could also consider options with breathable linings or perforations. Do you want me to provide some specific brands or models?",
