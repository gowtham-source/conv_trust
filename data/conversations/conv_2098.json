(Note: Prices vary based on location and sales. I've estimated based on national averages.)\n\n*   **Monday**: Vegetarian Chili ($12 estimated)\n*   **Tuesday**: Lentil Soup ($10 estimated)\n*   **Wednesday**: Tofu Stir-fry with Brown Rice ($15 estimated)\n*   **Thursday**: Pasta with Tomato Sauce & Veggies ($10 estimated)\n*   **Friday**: Homemade Pizza (using mostly pantry items: flour, sauce) - budget $10\n*   **Weekend**: Leftovers or budget-friendly eggs/toast/fruit ($18 estimated)\n\nShopping List (Estimates):\n*   Canned beans, lentils, tomatoes\n*   Rice and Pasta\n*   Tofu\n*   Frozen vegetables (broccoli, peas, etc. - cheaper and last longer)\n*   Fresh vegetables (onions, carrots, garlic, peppers) - try buying in bulk for better prices\n*   Dairy/dairy substitutes (milk, cheese - limited)\n*   Fruit for snacks\n\nOrganic options are very hard to keep, but you may be able to substitute a few items like canned tomatoes or frozen veggies. This should come in around $75. I can refine this further. Would you like me to find specific organic alternatives and adjust the shopping list, or do you have other requirements?",
