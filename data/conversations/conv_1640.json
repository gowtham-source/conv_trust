      "utterance": "Okay, that's a great question, and a common source of confusion. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n*   **Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible in the year they're made, potentially lowering your current tax bill. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.\n*   **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so you don't get a tax deduction now. However, qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.\n\nWhich is \"better\" depends on your current and future tax situation. Generally, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be better. I'd suggest consulting with a financial advisor to get tailored advice. Would you like help finding one?",
