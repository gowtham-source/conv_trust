Finding books with optimistic ecological themes within sci-fi, which often explores dystopian outcomes, requires looking for specific subgenres or authors. My recommendation process involves analyzing keywords, themes, plot summaries, and reader reviews across my database to identify potential matches. For your specific request, you might look into 'cli-fi' (climate fiction) that focuses on solutions, or works categorized as 'hopepunk'. *The Ministry for the Future* by Kim Stanley Robinson is often cited in this space, although it does touch on challenging issues. Another possibility might be *Half-Life* by Shelley Jackson, although that's less conventional sci-fi.",
