I recommend starting with these: A pair of well-fitting dark wash jeans (around $25-$30 at stores like Old Navy or Target), a neutral-colored t-shirt ($10-$15), a basic button-down shirt ($20-$25), and a comfortable cardigan or light jacket ($30-$40). These can be mixed and matched for various looks. Consider thrifting for even greater savings.",

      "utterance": "That's a good question! It depends on how much you value having a unique piece versus a functional wardrobe. Given your limited budget, prioritizing versatile basics is generally recommended. However, if you believe the sequin jacket would bring you significant joy and can be styled with at least 3 existing items in your closet, it might be worth the splurge. But carefully consider if foregoing one of the other items will leave a gap in your wardrobe. Perhaps look for ways to save on the other items (e.g., waiting for sales) before committing to the jacket.",
