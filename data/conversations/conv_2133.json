Second, you can file an appeal with your insurance company. The process for that is usually explained on your denial letter. Finally, depending on the specific circumstances of the care provided you could look into paying out of pocket.",

In many cases, the responsibility falls on both the provider and the patient, depending on the insurance plan's specific policies and the nature of the service. Some plans shift the responsibility fully to the patient for specific services. While I can't provide legal advice, the best course of action would be to review the specific terms of your insurance policy to see if it is the doctor or patient that is held responsible and you should potentially contact your provider for clarification. You might also consider contacting your state's insurance regulatory agency for guidance on whether the denial was handled fairly according to local regulations.",
