A company must assess the expected returns and associated costs. R&D invests in future innovation but might not offer immediate profit, while market expansion offers a chance for immediate revenue. The opportunity cost is then the profit from the other choice foregone. The choice depends on many factors like market conditions and financial standing of the company. This is a simplified explanation and might require a more in-depth analysis of the company.",
