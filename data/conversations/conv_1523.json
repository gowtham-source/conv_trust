Generally, you'll connect the black wires together (from the ceiling and the fixture), the white wires together, and the copper wire (ground) to the green wire or grounding screw on the fixture. You'll want to use wire connectors (wire nuts) to secure the connections. Make sure the power is OFF! It's also a good idea to use a wire stripper to expose the wires.",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! If your ceiling has two black wires, it likely means you have a switch leg and a power source wire. In this case, you'll connect both black wires from the ceiling to the black wire on the light fixture. You'll use a wire connector for this, of course. Make sure the power is OFF before you proceed. If you are uncomfortable with this step, please consult a qualified electrician.",
