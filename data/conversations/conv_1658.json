Specifically, what kind of software engineering roles have you held, and what were your key responsibilities and accomplishments in those roles? Also, what kind of position are you applying for (e.g., front-end, back-end, full-stack)? The more information you provide, the better I can assist you.

My responsibilities included building and maintaining web applications, writing unit tests, and collaborating with a team.

For instance, instead of saying 'Managed project X,' you could say: 'In a project where [Situation: we were experiencing high user churn], I was assigned the [Task: the responsibility to revamp the onboarding flow]. [Action: I redesigned the onboarding process using A/B testing, implemented more concise user guides, and reduced the number of required steps]. As a [Result: result, we saw a 15% decrease in user churn within the first quarter].'  I am still under development and learning how to best provide resume-specific assistance.
