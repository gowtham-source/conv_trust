To prepare, I recommend starting by brainstorming potential project ideas that align with the hackathon's theme, if any. Then, think about the skills you have and what technologies you'd like to learn. Forming a team can also be beneficial. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?",

Look for 'team formation' sessions or use the event's communication channels (like Slack or Discord) to introduce yourself and your skills. Be proactive in approaching others who seem to have complementary skills or interesting ideas. Don't be afraid to pitch your own ideas too! Remember, many attendees are also looking for teammates.",
