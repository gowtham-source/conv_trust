We'll push an update to your device within 24-48 hours. As for your question about the Wi-Fi receiver, various factors could influence Wi-Fi performance, including antenna placement and internal component design. While the SmartHub uses current Wi-Fi technology, differences in these internal design choices can sometimes lead to variations in signal strength compared to other devices. The upcoming update also includes enhancements to improve Wi-Fi stability. Please let us know if you experience further issues after the update.",
