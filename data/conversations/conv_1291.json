For a similar vibe to leather boots but with more everyday practicality, I'd recommend considering: chukka boots (more lightweight and ankle-height), leather sneakers (a stylish and comfortable option), or Chelsea boots (easy to slip on and off). If you're interested in weather-resistant options, look for boots with a water-resistant coating, or ones made from a waterproof material like Gore-Tex. Do any of those options appeal to you, or would you like me to search some specific brands?",
