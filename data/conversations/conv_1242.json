My definition of 'classic rock' in this context is music primarily influenced by rock and roll of the 1960s and 70s, incorporating elements of blues, hard rock, and early forms of heavy metal. It's tricky, I agree. To refine your search, what aspects of classic rock appeal to you most? Is it the guitar riffs, the vocals, the song structures, etc. Knowing that will help me provide more tailored suggestions.",
