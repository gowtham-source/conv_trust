For a heavier runner who overpronates, the Brooks Glycerin 20 might be a good starting point due to its neutral support and high cushioning which helps with impact. However, for overpronation specifically, you might benefit more from shoes in the 'stability' category, which offer more medial support. Would you like me to show you options from the 'stability running shoes' category instead? I can also filter by cushioning level.",
