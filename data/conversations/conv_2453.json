When I try to go 'deeper,' I analyze factors such as artist popularity metrics compared to genre averages, critical reception from various music publications, and connections within musical communities and subgenres, rather than just overall listener counts. My aim is to balance accessibility with suggesting artists that might be new to someone familiar with the genre's biggest names. It's an ongoing process of refinement based on available data.",
