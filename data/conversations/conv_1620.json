I'll also check for other options with better style ratings and similar support for flat feet, but the options are somewhat limited within your price range. One moment... [thinking sound effect]. Okay, I've found the New Balance Fresh Foam 860. They offer stability and are generally well-reviewed, but they may be slightly over your budget. What do you think of that? I am still refining my abilities in matching shoe aesthetics with user preferences, though. ",

While I can't guarantee a perfect fit without trying them on, I recommend reading reviews specifically mentioning flat feet. Also, our site has a generous return policy, so you can return them if they don't work out.
