Beyond fast fashion, you could look at retailers like Uniqlo, Mango (during sales), or even discount stores like Nordstrom Rack or TJ Maxx. They sometimes offer better quality basics at lower prices. For making clothes last, always check care labels, wash in cold water when possible, air dry items that are delicate, and store them properly.",

      "utterance": "That's a challenging but important question. While many dedicated sustainable brands have higher price points due to ethical production costs, finding affordable ethical fashion is becoming more accessible. Options include shopping second-hand (thrift stores, online marketplaces like Poshmark, Depop, or ThredUp), looking for brands that use recycled materials or have specific ethical lines within larger companies, or supporting local small businesses during sales. It requires more effort and searching compared to mainstream options.",

      "utterance": "I understand your skepticism; it's a complex issue. Finding brands that perfectly balance high ethical standards, style, and extremely low prices is difficult. However, focusing on longevity (buying fewer, better-quality pieces you love, even if slightly more expensive initially, and caring for them) or exploring rental services for specific occasions can also be seen as more sustainable budget strategies. Thrifting remains one of the most genuinely affordable *and* sustainable routes, requiring patience but yielding unique finds.",
