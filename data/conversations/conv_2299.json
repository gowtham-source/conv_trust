If you have *any* familiarity with Agile principles, even through coursework or a specific project, highlight that. Frame it as a willingness to learn and adapt quickly. You could state something like: 'While my experience with Agile methodologies is developing, I am eager to apply my foundational understanding...'. If you have *no* familiarity, you could mention that you are familiar with the concepts and are a fast learner. I recommend against outright lying because it can be easily discovered during the interview process. It's better to be honest but focus on your transferable skills and enthusiasm for the role.",
