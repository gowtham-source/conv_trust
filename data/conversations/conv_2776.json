Finding a thriller with absolutely zero jump scares is quite challenging, as they are a common tool for creating sudden tension. *Cach\u00e9* is a French film about a family receiving surveillance tapes that reveal unsettling secrets. For psychological dread without relying heavily on jump scares, you could explore films like *Hereditary* (though it has *some* intense moments, the dread is pervasive) or perhaps more subtle psychological horrors that border on thrillers, like *The Babadook*. Achieving zero jump scares while still being 'scary' is a tough balance to recommend directly within the thriller genre alone.",
