For example, you could consider: \n\n*   A blazer ($60-80)\n*   A pair of well-fitting chinos or dress pants ($50-70)\n*   A button-down shirt or a nice blouse ($40-60)\n\nThis leaves some room for accessories like a belt or a simple necklace. Would you like me to find some specific examples from online retailers?",

Can you give me alternative suggestions that are still suitable for a business-casual environment, but without a blazer? And also, can you show me specific items I can buy that are within the budget?

Here are some blazer alternatives, while still staying within budget and business casual guidelines:\n\n*   A fitted cardigan or a lightweight sweater.\n*   A stylish top, perhaps a nice silk blouse or a patterned top with a more structured fit. \n\nUnfortunately, providing specific links to items that are currently available and within your budget is beyond my current capabilities. I can help you locate retailers that you can check yourself, and I can provide examples of the types of items to look for, which will keep you in the budget.",
