Based on your preferences and budget, here's a potential shopping list: \n\n*   Chicken Breast (2 lbs): $10\n*   Long Grain Rice (5 lbs): $5\n*   Pasta (1 lb): $2\n*   Pasta Sauce (jar): $3\n*   Canned beans (2 cans): $2\n*   Frozen vegetables (mixed): $5\n*   Onions: $2\n*   Garlic: $1\n*   Eggs (dozen): $3\n*   Bread: $3\n*   Apples (bag): $7\n\nThis leaves you with roughly $32 for other items or unexpected price increases.

For the most accurate information, I'd need to know your specific location or preferred grocery stores. I can then try to find pricing from those stores. However, direct, real-time integration with store inventory is currently not available. For now, I would recommend checking your store's online flyer for the best deals. Also, consider that prices can and do fluctuate based on season.",
