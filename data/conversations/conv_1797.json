It's a low-budget, mind-bending time travel film that's very well-regarded, but be warned - it's a bit complex, and some viewers find it a little hard to follow initially. Another option is *Arrival* (2016), which deals with communication with aliens and features compelling character arcs. It has great reviews. How do those sound?",
