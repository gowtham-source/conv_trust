Based on your budget of $750-$850 for a work laptop, I recommend considering the Acer Aspire 5, the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5, or a refurbished MacBook Air from 2020.

Apple Certified Refurbished products come with a one-year warranty, just like new products. Third-party sellers like Amazon or Best Buy may offer shorter warranties, typically 90 days to a year. Always check the warranty details before purchasing! ",
