I've contacted them directly and they've confirmed the package is now in transit and should arrive within 2-3 business days. You can expect the tracking information to update within 24 hours. I apologize for the inconvenience. As for your question about our fulfillment process, while delays are rare, they can occur due to various factors like order volume, staffing, and carrier issues. We are continuously working to optimize our processes to minimize these occurrences.",
