I identify recurring themes, character archetypes, and plot devices that are frequently mentioned in negative contexts as being 'overused' or 'clich\u00e9d'. However, this data is inherently biased. For example, certain subgenres or authors might be unfairly labeled due to the reviewers who tend to cover them. I try to mitigate this by considering a wide range of sources and using algorithms that penalize overly simplistic or biased classifications, but I cannot guarantee a completely neutral assessment. My recommendations should always be viewed as suggestions, not definitive statements.",
