      "utterance": "Good job on the potential energy! Now, remember the law of conservation of energy: the total energy (PE + KE) remains constant. At the start, all the energy is potential. As the ball falls, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, at any point, PE + KE = initial PE. So, KE at 5 meters = Initial PE - PE at 5 meters = 196 Joules - 98 Joules = 98 Joules. Does that make sense? What if we introduced air resistance into this model, how would that affect the final speed of the ball?",
