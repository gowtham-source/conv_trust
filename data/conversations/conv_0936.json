First, remember the formula for potential energy: PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2), and h is height. Can you calculate the potential energy at 10 meters (the starting point) and at 5 meters?",

      "utterance": "Good job on the potential energy! Now, remember the law of conservation of energy: the total energy (PE + KE) remains constant. At the start, all the energy is potential. As the ball falls, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, at any point, PE + KE = initial PE. So, KE at 5 meters = Initial PE - PE at 5 meters = 196 Joules - 98 Joules = 98 Joules. Does that make sense? What if we introduced air resistance into this model, how would that affect the final speed of the ball?",
