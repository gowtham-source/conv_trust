This is about a plumbing issue he had fixed in the building's main stack, not even in my unit! He's trying to divide the cost among all tenants. The lease doesn't mention anything about sharing costs for major building plumbing repairs. Is that even legal? It seems like it should be his responsibility.",

Major structural or system repairs within a building, such as issues with the main plumbing stacks, are often considered the landlord's responsibility, especially if they are not caused by tenant negligence.

Determining the legality in your specific situation requires a detailed review of your full lease agreement and the relevant landlord-tenant laws in your state or city. While it may seem clear based on what you've described, only a qualified legal professional can provide a definitive answer and advise you on the best course of action, including whether the charge is legally permissible. Consulting with a local attorney or a tenant's rights organization would be the most reliable way to get advice tailored to your circumstances.",
