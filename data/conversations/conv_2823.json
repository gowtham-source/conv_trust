If that fails, options typically include mediation, or potentially pursuing legal action such as filing a quiet title action to get a court ruling on the correct boundary. Please remember, I cannot provide legal advice, and specific procedures vary by location.",

      "utterance": "That's a very pertinent and challenging question. There isn't a simple rule that an older or newer survey automatically takes precedence. While older surveys might reflect the original intent better, newer surveys often use more precise technology. Courts evaluate the quality, methodology, and supporting evidence of *each* survey. They look for consistency with original property descriptions and physical evidence. It's not just age or technology, but the surveyor's adherence to surveying principles and the hierarchy of evidence in property law that matters.",

Arguing the validity of a survey, especially when evidence is missing or technology differs, involves presenting a case based on legal principles of boundary establishment, the specific history of the property, and the quality of the remaining evidence. An attorney specializing in real estate law can analyze the specifics of both surveys, the property history, and local case law to build the strongest argument for your boundary line.
