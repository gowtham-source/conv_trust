If we haven't received it by then, we'll reach out to explore alternative options, such as getting a second opinion from another shop. If the car is deemed a total loss, the settlement amount would be based on the actual cash value of your vehicle, taking into account depreciation and condition prior to the accident. We use a market valuation tool to determine this value, and you'll have the opportunity to review that valuation and provide supporting documentation if you believe it's inaccurate.
