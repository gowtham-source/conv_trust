Also, have you explored the works of Becky Chambers? Her 'Wayfarers' series is very popular, often described as 'cozy sci-fi'. Could you tell me a bit about what you *dislike* about the sci-fi you've been reading lately? That will help me tailor the recommendations.",

I'm tired of the overly-technical hard sci-fi, and the space operas all feel the same. Something with a strong story, maybe a bit philosophical? Oh, and avoid anything with excessive violence if possible, please.",

      "utterance": "Alright, that helps a lot! Based on your preferences, I'd recommend 'A Fire Upon the Deep' by Vernor Vinge. It's a classic, explores some fascinating concepts regarding zones of thought, and has a strong narrative focus. It's not *entirely* free of violence, but it's not gratuitous. Also, 'The Sparrow' by Mary Doria Russell, while technically sci-fi, delves deeply into themes of religion and first contact, with a more thoughtful and less action-oriented approach. It could be just what you're looking for. Regarding the 'philosophical' aspect, could you tell me which philosophical concepts interest you? This will allow for a better tailored response in the future.",
