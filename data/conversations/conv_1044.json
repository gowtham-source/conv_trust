I see a recent debit card transaction for $50 at 'Joe's Cafe' and a recurring charge of $25 to 'Streaming Services Inc.' on the 15th of this month. Regarding overdraft fees, our policy is a $35 fee per transaction that overdraws the account. These fees are in place to cover the cost associated with processing transactions when sufficient funds are not available. The exact reasoning for the amount is complex, influenced by factors such as regulatory compliance and risk management. More details are available in the account agreement document on our website.",
