I can look for options with solid-state drives (SSDs) as those greatly improve responsiveness within your budget. However, since prices fluctuate, the exact specifications will vary, so the available models will depend on what's in stock right now. I've found a few decent models, ranging in price from $650 to $780. The Dell Inspiron 15, the Acer Aspire 5, and the HP 15-ef series all are generally well-reviewed and frequently fall within your budget. Would you like me to provide more specific details, including links to the product pages?",

I primarily focus on pricing, availability, and general specifications. While I can access some basic performance metrics (like CPU and RAM) for a given model, providing detailed comparisons of read/write speeds or other granular performance details would require a much more sophisticated system than I currently have. I'd recommend you browse the manufacturers' websites to access such detailed specifications and benchmarks.
