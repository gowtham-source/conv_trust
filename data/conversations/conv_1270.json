It usually means that any disputes, including a wrongful termination claim, would be resolved through arbitration rather than a court. Arbitration can be faster and less expensive than a lawsuit, but it also limits your options for appeal. You should review the specific terms of your agreement and consult with an attorney as soon as possible to determine the impact on your case. Do you have any other questions at this time?",
