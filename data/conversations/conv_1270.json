In California, it is illegal to terminate an employee for reporting harassment. The fact you have emails supporting your claim is helpful. I can generate information about California laws related to wrongful termination and retaliation, but for more specific advice, you should consult with a California employment lawyer.

However, I can inform you that many employment lawyers offer initial consultations free of charge. It's also common for these types of cases to be taken on a contingency basis, meaning the lawyer's fee is a percentage of any settlement or judgment you receive. It's important to understand the fee structure *before* proceeding with legal action. Do you have any other questions?",

It usually means that any disputes, including a wrongful termination claim, would be resolved through arbitration rather than a court. Arbitration can be faster and less expensive than a lawsuit, but it also limits your options for appeal. You should review the specific terms of your agreement and consult with an attorney as soon as possible to determine the impact on your case. Do you have any other questions at this time?",
