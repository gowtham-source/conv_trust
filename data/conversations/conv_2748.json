The interviewer is usually looking to see your creativity, ability to think on your feet, and how you relate abstract concepts back to relevant qualities. For the tree example, you could connect traits of a certain tree (like resilience, growth, providing shade/support) to your own professional attributes. The key is to stay calm and try to find a link, however abstract, that reflects positively on you.",
