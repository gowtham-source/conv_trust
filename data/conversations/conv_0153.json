While that's still a factor, it's also evolved to describe a certain sound: often guitar-based, experimental, and with a focus on songwriting and authenticity over commercial appeal. It's a complex genre with blurred lines, I admit! As for 'Built to Spill', I recommend their album 'Perfect From Now On', and for 'Yo La Tengo' try 'And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out'.",
