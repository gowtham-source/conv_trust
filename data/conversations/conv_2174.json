Users post updates, other users see them, and the system has to scale to millions or billions of users. A key question is, what are the read and write patterns? For questions, consider the following:\n\n*   What kind of database would you choose and why?\n*   How would you handle a sudden spike in traffic?\n*   How would you deal with users posting a lot of media?\n\nDoes that help?",

      "utterance": "Good question! Generally, a NoSQL database is often preferred for social media feeds because they can handle the massive scale and flexible data models better. Relational databases (SQL) can be used, but scaling them horizontally can be complex. Relational databases excel at relationships while NoSQL systems trade data relationships for scalability. This is a complex issue, so the best answer often depends on the specific requirements of your system design. I can give you more information on these considerations, would you like that?",
