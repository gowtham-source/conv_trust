      "utterance": "I understand your concerns! Ethical and affordable fashion can be tricky, but it's possible. One option is to check out consignment shops or online resale platforms like ThredUp or Poshmark for gently used, high-quality pieces. You can often find brands with ethical practices at significantly reduced prices. Another strategy is to focus on building a capsule wardrobe with versatile basics from brands that prioritize fair labor and sustainable materials, even if you only buy one or two items initially. For example, a well-fitting pair of sustainably sourced jeans ($50-$80 from a brand like Everlane or Pact), a neutral-colored blouse ($30-$50 from a brand like TenTree), and a blazer from a thrift store would easily fall within your budget and create a smart casual look. What do you think about these options?",
