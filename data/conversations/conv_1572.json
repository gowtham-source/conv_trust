The usual procedure is to first verify the fee schedule in your billing system against the payer's fee schedule for that specific code and date of service. You can usually find this information on the payer's website or by contacting them directly. Next, you might need to review your contract with the payer to confirm the agreed-upon rates. If the billed amount is incorrect, you'd resubmit with the correct amount. If it's correct, you'll need to appeal the denial, providing documentation such as the original claim and any supporting documentation of the services provided to support your bill. However, the process for appealing can vary widely by the payer. Is there a specific payer you're having issues with?",
