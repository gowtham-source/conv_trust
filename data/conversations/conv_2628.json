While the Anker provides good ANC for its category, the Sony WF-1000XM4 (and similar high-end models like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds) use more advanced processors and algorithms, offering significantly superior noise cancellation, especially for higher frequencies and voices. They also typically have better audio codecs and overall sound fidelity, and often more premium build quality or features.",
