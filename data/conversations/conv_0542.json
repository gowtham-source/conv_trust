A strong cover letter usually includes these elements: a brief introduction, highlighting 2-3 key skills/experiences relevant to the job description, explaining why you're interested in Acme Corp, and a strong closing. I suggest starting with the introduction. Can you tell me in one sentence what makes you a good candidate for this role?",

Something like: \"At my previous role, I spearheaded a social media campaign that increased engagement by 30%. This was achieved through a data-driven strategy...\" You can then subtly mention that you understand Acme's more corporate tone and would adapt your approach accordingly. Does that help?",
