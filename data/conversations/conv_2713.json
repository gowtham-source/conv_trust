Finding truly 'hidden gems' can be subjective, and confirming explicit vegan menu items without direct restaurant contact is sometimes challenging as online menus aren't always comprehensive or up-to-date in my database. I can filter for highly-rated places that mention accommodating dietary restrictions, but I can't guarantee they have a dedicated, marked vegan section on their public menu. Would you like me to proceed with that broader filter?",
