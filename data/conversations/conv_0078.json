Professional-grade acrylics have higher pigment concentration, resulting in richer colors and better lightfastness. They also tend to blend more smoothly. For a gift, unless your niece is creating art to sell or display in a gallery, the student grade will probably be more than sufficient.",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! The longevity does differ. Professional grade paints will typically have much better lightfastness ratings and be much more resistant to fading over time. Student grade paints may exhibit some fading over years, especially if exposed to direct sunlight, but if stored properly fading is unlikely to be significant for several years. For archival purposes, professional grade is highly recommended.",
