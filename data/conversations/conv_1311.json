With wide feet, I'd suggest looking at brands that offer wide sizes, like New Balance, or some styles of Vans. Adidas also can be a good choice as they are sometimes wider. It's always best to try on shoes if possible, but I can also provide links to detailed sizing information and reviews for the specific models once we narrow down some choices based on your preferred style.",
