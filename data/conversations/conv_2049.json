Based on that, for around $75, here's a possible grocery list for the week: Chicken breasts, brown rice, broccoli, carrots, onions, canned beans (black or kidney), eggs, and some apples and bananas for snacks. This should provide a good balance of protein, carbs, and fiber.  Would you like a more detailed breakdown with estimated prices?",

Here are some meal ideas using your ingredients, to provide some variety:\n\n*   **Chicken and Rice Bowl:** Chicken, rice, steamed broccoli, and a sauce made with some beans.\n*   **Chicken Stir-Fry:** Chicken stir-fried with onions, carrots, and rice.\n*   **Chicken and Vegetable Soup:** Use the chicken, carrots, onions and broccoli. Leftover rice can be added too.\n*   **Breakfast:** Eggs with a side of fruit.\n*   **Snacks:** Apples, bananas, and a handful of beans.\n\nExperiment with spices to change the flavors!
