They usually have good sales and trendy pieces.  I'd suggest starting with a pair of black skinny jeans ($30-40), a graphic tee ($15-20), and a denim jacket ($30-40). That leaves you some wiggle room. Does that sound good?",

      "utterance": "You're right, that's a valid point. Quality can vary. I don't have real-time data on every item's quality unfortunately, as that is constantly changing and dependent on the retailer. However, I can suggest checking customer reviews on the retailer's websites to get a sense of the quality before you purchase. You might also look for items made from better materials like cotton instead of synthetic materials to ensure better quality. For a jacket, consider thrifting, you might find something great at a lower price point.",

On the ASOS website, for instance, you can select the 'Price' filter under the 'Filter & Sort' options. On H&M and Zara, you'll find similar options. They usually allow you to set a maximum price. Just set it to whatever is comfortable for you - $30, $50, etc.",
