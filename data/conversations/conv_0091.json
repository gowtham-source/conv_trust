      "utterance": "Okay, for versatility, I'd recommend a dark brown leather loafer or a plain black oxford. As for Oxfords vs. Balmorals, the key difference lies in the lacing system. Oxfords have a 'closed lacing' system, meaning the facing (where the laces go) is stitched directly to the vamp (the front part of the shoe), creating a cleaner, more streamlined look. Balmorals, on the other hand, can have either closed or open lacing (like a Derby shoe), but are defined by their decorative seam that runs around the shoe at the point where the vamp and quarters meet. So, while all Oxfords are technically Balmorals because of that seam, not all Balmorals are Oxfords because they might have open lacing. I hope that clears things up!",
