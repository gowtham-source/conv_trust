If you're open to something slightly different, you might enjoy the dream-pop sound of Beach House, or maybe explore some folk-influenced indie with Bon Iver. Are any of those appealing?",

Is there a band that's like, up-and-coming or a little more obscure that you'd recommend? And while we're at it, why *are* certain bands considered \"indie\" anyway?

      "utterance": "Okay, for a less well-known indie rock band, I suggest checking out a group called Geese. They have a raw, post-punk sound that's been getting a lot of buzz. As for your question about what qualifies as \"indie,\" it's complicated! Generally, it refers to bands initially signed to independent labels, giving them more creative control. While many do eventually sign with major labels, the 'indie' tag often sticks if their initial sound and ethos were established independently. It's become as much about a band's aesthetic and approach as it is about their label affiliation. Does that help clarify things?",
