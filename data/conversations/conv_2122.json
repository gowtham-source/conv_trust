To start, it sounds like you are facing a property dispute. Your options depend on various factors, including local ordinances, the type of tree, and how the tree fell. The first step is to review any documentation you have regarding the tree and the incident. Do you have any such documents?",

Proving this can be challenging if you lack documentation. You might need to present photographic evidence or even hire a surveyor to help you with this. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide specific legal strategies for proving ownership at this time, as that requires more data analysis.",

Generally, if the tree fell due to a natural event and there was no evidence of negligence on your part (e.g., failing to maintain a diseased or unstable tree), you may not be liable. However, some jurisdictions have specific laws about trees. You should research the ordinances specific to your location. Consider searching for local property law experts to review your case in detail. Good luck.",
