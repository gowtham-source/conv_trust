While non-refundable rooms typically don't allow cancellations for personal reasons, significant issues like undisclosed construction often warrant a refund or compensation. In such cases, I recommend contacting the hotel directly upon arrival to explain the situation. If they are uncooperative, contact our customer support immediately with photographic evidence, and we will advocate on your behalf. Many hotels will attempt to rectify the problem by offering an alternative room or, in severe cases, a refund. I am showing you a few options now, all with high cleanliness/amenity scores.",
