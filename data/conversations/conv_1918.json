      "utterance": "Hello! Absolutely. Opportunity cost refers to the potential benefits an individual, investor, or business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. In simpler terms, it's the value of the next best alternative that wasn't chosen. Let's say you have $100. You can buy a book or a video game. The opportunity cost of buying the book is the enjoyment you would have gotten from the video game, and vice-versa. Does that make sense?",
