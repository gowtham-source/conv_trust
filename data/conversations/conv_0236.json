Generally, landlords are required to return security deposits within a certain timeframe (this varies by state) and can only withhold funds for legitimate damages beyond normal wear and tear. Your photos are excellent evidence. You have the right to dispute these charges. I recommend sending a certified letter demanding the full deposit back, citing the move-in photos as proof. If that doesn't work, you may need to pursue a small claims court case.",

However, there may be local ordinances regarding pets that could apply even if not stated in the lease. He can't just retroactively add terms.
