Generally, landlords are required to return security deposits within a certain timeframe (this varies by state) and can only withhold funds for legitimate damages beyond normal wear and tear. Your photos are excellent evidence. You have the right to dispute these charges. I recommend sending a certified letter demanding the full deposit back, citing the move-in photos as proof. If that doesn't work, you may need to pursue a small claims court case.",

But here's the thing â€“ he's also claiming I violated the lease by having a pet, even though it doesn't say anything about pets being prohibited in the lease agreement. How can he claim a violation when it's not even in the contract? Can he just make stuff up as he goes along? This whole thing is ridiculous!",

Generally, lease agreements are interpreted strictly, and any ambiguity is usually resolved in favor of the tenant. However, there may be local ordinances regarding pets that could apply even if not stated in the lease. He can't just retroactively add terms. It's still a good idea to check with a local attorney for specifics regarding your particular area.",
