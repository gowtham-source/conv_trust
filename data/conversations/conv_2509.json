For science fiction that offers a fresh perspective, I recommend 'Ancillary Justice' by Ann Leckie, 'Project Hail Mary' by Andy Weir, and 'Blindsight' by Peter Watts. These titles are highly acclaimed and often praised for their innovative concepts.",

Those are all pretty well-known. I guess I was hoping for something a bit more obscure maybe? Or how do you even know these are 'fresh' or 'innovative'? Do you, like, read reviews or summaries?

My recommendations are based on processing vast amounts of data, including reviews, ratings, literary analyses, and thematic tags from numerous sources. I identify patterns related to critical reception, reader feedback highlighting uniqueness, awards, and comparisons to other works. While I can't guarantee subjective enjoyment, I can identify books that are statistically likely to be considered innovative or highly regarded within a genre based on collective human opinion. Given your preference for something potentially more obscure or less hard sci-fi, perhaps look into 'The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet' by Becky Chambers (more character-driven) or 'Recursion' by Blake Crouch (sci-fi thriller, very mind-bending).",
