      "utterance": "That's a fair question. While *Old World* and *Crusader Kings* both involve dynasty management, *Old World* emphasizes the individual leaders and their relationships more directly. It also features a limited orders system each turn, which adds a unique layer of strategic decision-making. The historical setting is also different, focusing on classical antiquity rather than the medieval period. In essence, *Old World* places more emphasis on the tactical and strategic impact of individual characters, while *Crusader Kings* is broader and allows for more emergent storytelling.",
