While premium comfort is often found in higher price ranges, you can find surprisingly comfortable options under $60, especially if you look at brands known for good value like Anker Soundcore (often their Life series) or Koss. Comfort reviews from other users are very important in this segment. Look for models with plush earcups and adjustable headbands.",

      "utterance": "For sound quality under $60, you're generally looking for a balanced sound profile. Avoid models that excessively boost bass, as this often sacrifices clarity. Check reviews for mentions of 'clear mids' and 'defined highs'. Specific driver size (e.g., 40mm or 50mm) can give an indication, but tuning is more crucial. Some models like the Koss Porta Pro (though on-ear, their KPH series is over-ear) or certain older wired Sennheiser models if you find them on sale might offer better audio fidelity than typical budget wireless options.",
