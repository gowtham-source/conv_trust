Unfortunately, the system doesn't always log the specific reason for a lack of updates or a delay. 'In Transit' generally means it's still moving through the network, though a lack of scans can occur for various reasons. At this point, we recommend allowing another 1-2 business days for the status to update. If there's still no movement by then, we can initiate a formal missing mail search request for you.
