For protein on a budget, consider options like lentils, beans, eggs, and chicken thighs, which are typically cheaper than other cuts. For vegetables, look for seasonal produce, root vegetables like potatoes and carrots, or frozen vegetables which are often more economical and last longer. Planning meals around these staples can help stretch your budget while ensuring you get necessary nutrients. Focus on simple, versatile ingredients.",
