When estimating retirement needs with fluctuating income, it's important to take a conservative approach. I'd recommend using a method like averaging your income over the last 3-5 years to get a reasonable estimate, and then adjust for any projected changes in your business. You may also want to consider consulting with a financial advisor for more specific advice based on your unique circumstances, as I am still under development and cannot provide advice.
