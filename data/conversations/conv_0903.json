The severance package includes 2 weeks of pay per year of service and continuation of health insurance for 3 months, but they're also asking me to sign a really broad non-disparagement agreement. It basically says I can't say anything negative about the company *ever*, which feels unreasonable, especially since I was laid off!",

A blanket prohibition against *any* negative statements, especially after a layoff, could be considered overly broad. It might be worth negotiating that specific clause. Also, are you sure the two weeks of pay per year of service is within the norm? What are you seeing online about similar roles?",

While I can't provide specific legal advice without a formal attorney-client relationship, I can point you towards resources that discuss relevant cases. A good place to start would be searching California case law related to employment contracts and non-disparagement clauses. You can use keywords such as 'California non-disparagement agreement enforceability' in a legal database. Would you like some links to such databases?",

The breadth of the agreement, the public nature of your statements, and the potential damages to the company would all be factors considered. It's always best to err on the side of caution.
