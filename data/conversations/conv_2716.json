So, focus on getting a small emergency fund, then tackling debt (my student loan isn't super high interest, so maybe not number 1 priority unless I want it gone?), then maybe saving for the down payment heavily, and then retirement. That gives me a much better structure to think about things. Thank you!",

You can adapt the exact order slightly based on your personal debt interest rates and comfort level, but that framework provides a solid foundation for allocating your funds strategically towards multiple goals.
