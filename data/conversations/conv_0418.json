Consider meals such as lentil soup, rice and beans with sauteed vegetables, and simple pasta dishes with tomato sauce. To save money, shop store brands and buy in bulk when possible.

For example, you could make a large batch of chili with ground turkey (which is often cheaper than beef), canned tomatoes, beans, and frozen vegetables. This will provide several meals. Another option is chicken stir-fry with lots of affordable vegetables like cabbage and carrots. I can refine a grocery list if you provide a store and location. Would you be open to providing that information?",
