I suggest focusing on essential items like a good pair of jeans ($40-$60), a few basic tees ($10-$15 each), a neutral cardigan or jacket ($30-$50), and some comfortable sneakers ($30-$50). We can find affordable options at stores like H&M, Old Navy, or Target. Would you like me to provide specific links to items within these stores?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! While lower-priced clothing may not have the same longevity as designer brands, there are definitely ways to maximize their lifespan. Look for fabrics that blend natural and synthetic fibers (e.g., cotton-polyester blends), as they tend to be more durable. Check the seams and stitching for any loose threads or unevenness. And most importantly, follow the care instructions on the label carefully. Proper washing and drying can significantly extend the life of your clothes. Also, check reviews online before buying to see what other customers say about the durability. I can also look for brands that are known for having decent quality at lower prices.",
