Another option could be Vans Old Skool, in a solid color like black or white. They have a clean look, are comfortable and relatively affordable. The Nike Killshot is another strong option. Do you have a preferred material, like leather, canvas, or synthetic?",

The Altra Escalante is a possibility, but depending on the specific model, can be on the higher end. I also recommend looking at models from Topo Athletic. I will look for shoes with the exact specifications that fit your preferences. Please provide me with your budget to assist you.",

It comes in various neutral colors, is often available under your budget, and offers a sleek aesthetic. You can also consider the New Balance 515, which comes in a variety of colors. Please check online retailers for the most up-to-date pricing and availability. I hope you find what you are looking for!",
