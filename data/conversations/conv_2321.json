      "utterance": "I understand. Leaks are the worst. Based on your description, here's what to check:\n\n1.  **Connection to the sink:** Ensure the faucet base is properly sealed against the sink surface. Check for any missing or damaged gaskets.\n2.  **Water lines connection:** Double-check the compression fittings or connections where you attached the water lines. Make sure they are tight but not over-tightened.\n3.  **Cartridge/Valve (if applicable):** For single-handle faucets, there's often a cartridge or valve inside the faucet body. If this isn't sealed properly it could cause a leak. Often, you need to tighten or replace this part of the faucet.\n\nCould you tell me what kind of mounting system your faucet has?",

      "utterance": "Certainly! There are a few common causes for a slow-retracting or blocked spray hose:\n\n1.  **Obstruction:** The hose might be rubbing against something under the sink (garbage disposal, pipes, etc.). Inspect the path of the hose to make sure it has a clear route.\n2.  **Kinks/Bends:** The hose itself might have a kink or bend, especially if it's a new installation and hasn't been 'broken in' yet.\n3.  **Hose Weight:** Many faucets have a weight on the hose to help it retract. If the weight is positioned incorrectly, it could be causing the hose to get stuck. Check that the weight is properly attached and positioned correctly as indicated in your faucet's manual. The exact position varies between models.\n4. **Buildup:** Over time mineral buildup in the hose itself can make it stick or retract slowly. Run the faucet spray through all possible angles to see if this is the case.\n\nCan you tell me more about your setup, such as the brand and model of your faucet?",
