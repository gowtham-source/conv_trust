Color blocking or subtle texture variations can also add visual interest without sacrificing the minimalist aesthetic. Consider sneakers with a slightly chunkier sole for a more modern look. Brands like Common Projects, Axel Arigato, or even a well-chosen pair of Adidas Stan Smiths with a unique colorway could work. Would you like me to search for some specific examples?",
