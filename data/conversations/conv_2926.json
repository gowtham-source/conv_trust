Focusing on whole foods can be tricky on that budget, but here are some staples: dry beans and lentils (very cheap protein), rice or pasta, eggs, and seasonal vegetables like carrots, potatoes, onions, and cabbage which tend to be inexpensive. Buying frozen vegetables can also be a good budget-friendly option for variety. Planning meals around these items will be key.",
