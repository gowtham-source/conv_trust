Another option is to check if cloud-based versions of those programs exist. For example, many Microsoft Office programs have web-based alternatives.",

For example, the Acer Aspire 5 or the ASUS Vivobook series often have models available within that price range. These would offer better compatibility with older software. They might not be high-end gaming machines, but they'll be a step up from Chromebooks in terms of versatility. Here's a link to the Acer Aspire 5 on Amazon: [link to Amazon].
