For a more relaxed vibe, you can wear thin dress socks that complement your outfit, but avoid thick athletic socks. Some people even go sockless, though that's more common in warmer weather.",

While I don't have a single, comprehensive database rating all shoe companies on environmental and labor practices, I can suggest searching for certifications like B Corp or Fair Trade. Brands with these certifications have undergone rigorous assessment. You might also find resources and brand ratings on websites focused on sustainable fashion, such as Good On You or websites run by ethical fashion bloggers. Searching for terms like 'ethical loafers brands' should provide some good starting points.",
