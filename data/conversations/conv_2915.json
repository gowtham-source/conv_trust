Central Suites London (4 stars) - breakfast available (additional charge may apply).",

The City View Inn sounds promising with 'includes continental breakfast', but I'm worried about its location. Are any of these hotels actually in the Covent Garden or West End area, and do they *definitely* offer free breakfast, not just paid options?",
