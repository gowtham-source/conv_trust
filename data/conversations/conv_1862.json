Instead, each element, or node, contains a data field and a pointer (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The basic operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal. A useful analogy is a treasure hunt, where each clue (node) tells you where to find the next clue. Now, let me find you an example implementation...",

You have two pointers: one moves one node at a time (the tortoise), and the other moves two nodes at a time (the hare). If the linked list has a cycle, the hare will eventually catch up to the tortoise. This is O(1) space complexity because it uses only two pointers. Would you like a deeper dive into the pseudocode or an example?",
