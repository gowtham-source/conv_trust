For example, you could get a good pair of jeans (look for sales!), a few basic t-shirts in neutral colors, and maybe a versatile cardigan or jacket. You could also check out stores like H&M, Primark (if you have one), or even thrift stores for budget-friendly options. Does that sound like a good starting point?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! The 'secret sauce' is definitely in the details and accessories. With a limited budget, focus on a few key accessories that can elevate your basics. Think a stylish belt, a statement necklace (check thrift stores for unique finds!), a colorful scarf, or even just a good pair of shoes (consider buying gently used). Also, pay attention to fit \u2013 even inexpensive clothes can look great if they fit well. Tailoring can make a huge difference, but if that's not in the budget, learning some basic alterations yourself could be a game-changer. Finally, try adding one 'trend' piece that you really love, even if it's just a fun patterned shirt from a discount store. Mixing that in with your basics can prevent the 'boring' look.",
