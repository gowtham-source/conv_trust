It explores a unique take on English history with a focus on the return of magic. Or, for a different tone, *Piranesi* by Susanna Clarke. It's not as heavily magic-focused but it has a really unique setting that might interest you. The descriptions in this book can be a little difficult to follow, however.",

But I'd suggest checking out *Rivers of London* by Ben Aaronovitch, which blends urban fantasy with a police procedural. Or, you might enjoy *Gideon the Ninth* by Tamsyn Muir, which combines space opera with necromantic fantasy. Hopefully one of these will work for you!",
