Things like project management logs, communications showing his involvement in other projects at the time, or witness testimony from other team members could help demonstrate that he wasn't actively involved. The key is to build a preponderance of evidence suggesting his non-participation. Finding that specific contract wording is crucial though, it will be the foundation of your defense.",
