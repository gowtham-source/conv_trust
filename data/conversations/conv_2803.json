Based on the focus on character-driven tactical combat within a larger campaign structure, you might consider games like the Total War series (which has real-time battles but strategic turn-based campaigns) or perhaps the King Arthur: Knight's Tale series, which blends tactics with campaign management and RPG progression. Would exploring tactical RPGs with strategic campaign layers be closer to what you're looking for?",
