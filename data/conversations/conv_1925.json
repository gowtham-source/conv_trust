You can frame them as a period of personal development (e.g., focused on family care, volunteering, further education, or a career break for travel). Emphasize any skills you gained during that time. For example, if you were a stay-at-home parent, you can highlight skills like time management, project management (related to family activities), and communication skills.",

Analyze the job descriptions for the positions you're interested in and identify the skills the employer is looking for. Then, examine your past experiences and identify any instances where you've demonstrated those skills, even if the context was different. For instance, if you're switching from retail to project management, highlight any projects you managed, deadlines you met, or customer service skills you utilized. We can work through the resume together to properly format and highlight these transferable skills.",
