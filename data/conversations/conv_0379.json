Alternatively, consider vintage-inspired boots with a slight heel, maybe something with button detailing if you can find it. A dark, worn-looking pair of combat boots could also work, providing a subtle rebellious edge to the preppy style. What do you think of these?",

The key is to find a balance. Avoid overly polished or patent leather monk straps for a less formal look. You could also try a double monk strap for a more modern feel.",
