I can also suggest 'The Burger Joint,' but since you mentioned no pizza, I'll focus on the others first. Anything sound good, or perhaps something else you'd prefer?",

Unfortunately, while I have access to reviews and menus, specific details about tortilla types and guacamole freshness aren't always explicitly mentioned. However, I *can* see many reviews praising the guacamole and mentioning the food as 'authentic'. I would suggest ordering the 'Guac & Chips' to test it out and, if it's to your liking, order more. I can also see they offer both corn and flour tortillas. Do you want me to place an order for you, or would you like to call them yourself?",
