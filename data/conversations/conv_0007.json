Is it mostly natural light, or do you rely more on artificial lighting? Also, what other colors are already present in the room (furniture, flooring)? Knowing this will help narrow down the best grey for your space. We can also talk about undertones - some grays lean cool (blue/green undertones) while others are warmer (yellow/brown undertones).",

Satin is slightly more durable and easier to clean than eggshell, so it's a good option if you have kids or pets. Flat paint is generally not recommended for living rooms as it's difficult to clean. Semi-gloss is best suited for trim and doors.",

      "utterance": "Minor imperfections can become more noticeable after painting, especially with higher sheen paints. Before painting, you can use a patching compound (like spackle or drywall mud) to fill in the dents and dings. Sand the patched areas smooth once the compound is dry. For deeper imperfections, you may need to apply multiple layers of patching compound, allowing each layer to dry completely before sanding. Priming after patching and sanding is also a great idea to ensure uniform paint adhesion and hide the repairs.",

Primer helps ensure uniform color coverage, improves paint adhesion, and can even help block stains. Think of it as insurance against a patchy or uneven finish. If you skip it, you might need to apply extra coats of paint, which can end up costing you more in the long run.",
