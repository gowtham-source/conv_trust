For upbeat yet thoughtful Indie Pop that's great for a walk, consider artists like The 1975 (their earlier albums), Vampire Weekend, or Chvrches. An album like 'Contra' by Vampire Weekend or 'The Bones of What You Believe' by Chvrches might be a good starting point. Do any of those resonate or sound interesting?",
