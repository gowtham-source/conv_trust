They often work well with athleisure wear or more modern, minimalist outfits. The Nike Air Max 90s, on the other hand, have a more retro, chunky vibe. They can add a pop of color and texture to an outfit and work well with more vintage-inspired or streetwear styles. Essentially, NMDs are sleeker and more modern, while Air Max 90s are bolder and more retro.",

      "utterance": "That's a tricky question! A general rule is that lighter brown boots tend to pair well with lighter wash jeans, creating a more relaxed and casual look. Darker brown boots offer more contrast and work well with dark wash and black jeans for a more polished appearance. However, fashion is subjective, and experimenting is key! Consider the overall tone of the outfit and whether you want the boots to stand out or blend in. You could also look online for style guides that offer examples. I, unfortunately, cannot visually show you the combinations but can point you to web pages if that is helpful.",
