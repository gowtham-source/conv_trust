      "utterance": "I completely understand your frustration; rising food costs are a real challenge. To make the list stretch and add variety, focus on bulk items like rice, pasta, and dried beans \u2013 they offer many servings for a low cost. You can create different meals by varying spices and preparations. For example, dried beans can become chili, soup, or bean burgers. Rice can be a base for stir-fries (with frozen veggies and a small amount of meat/beans) or rice and beans. Eggs are versatile for breakfast or dinner. Consider making larger batches of staple meals like lentil soup or bean stew that can be eaten over a couple of days. Buying generic brands often saves money too. Would you like me to give you an example meal plan using these items?",
