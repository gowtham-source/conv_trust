For books focusing on magic systems and character development, with a strong female lead, I'd recommend 'Mistborn: The Final Empire' by Brandon Sanderson (though it's a larger ensemble, Vin is definitely a strong lead), and 'Uprooted' by Naomi Novik.

I use a vast database of book information, including genre classifications, plot summaries, and character details. I also analyze user reviews, critic reviews, and literary awards data to identify books that are consistently praised for their strong female characters. Additionally, I'm programmed with a complex understanding of common literary tropes and narrative archetypes to make a more accurate assessment. I am always learning and improving in this area.",
