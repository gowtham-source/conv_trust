Consider exploring secondhand options like ThredUp or Poshmark; you can often find high-quality, pre-owned minimalist pieces for a fraction of the original price. Also, look into brands like Pact or Everlane's \"Choose What You Pay\" section for discounted, sustainable basics. I can provide links to specific items currently available on those sites if you'd like!",
