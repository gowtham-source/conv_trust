According to my information you chose standard shipping at checkout, which does not guarantee a delivery date. Expedited options are available and can be chosen during checkout. If you would like to know more about the difference between shipping methods I can provide a link to our FAQ page. I can also look into what expedited options are available and how much they would cost to ship your package faster, however this might incur additional costs.",
