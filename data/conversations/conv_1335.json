Then, try the basin wrench again. If that doesn't work, you might need to use a rust penetrant and a little heat (carefully!). Make sure to turn off the water supply and put down towels to catch drips. If it is really bad, you might need to cut the pipes. Do you know if your shut off valves work?",

      "utterance": "The shut-off valve reliability depends heavily on its usage and quality. Sometimes, if they haven't been touched in a while, they won't work. Another option for the nuts, though less effective, is a nut splitter tool. It can split the nut rather than turning it. You'll have to replace the valve, but it eliminates the need for heat or pipe cutting. I'd recommend the nut splitter, but be aware that it still may not work if the nuts are extremely corroded. Always shut off the water supply before attempting any of these options.",
