Web development, AI, mobile apps, etc. Knowing this will help you find a hackathon that aligns with your skills and goals. Also, consider your skill level. Some hackathons are beginner-friendly, while others are more advanced.",

Introduce yourself and your skills, and look for others with complementary skills and a similar level of commitment. Don't be afraid to ask potential teammates about their previous experience and availability. You can also browse the profiles of other participants to see if anyone's skills match your needs. Many platforms also have channels dedicated to team formation. Another strategy, though less direct, is to review participants' public GitHub or other profiles to assess their technical competence. This involves some work but may pay off.",
