Based on your preferences, I recommend checking out 'The Way of Kings' by Brandon Sanderson (The Stormlight Archive), 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' by Scott Lynch (Gentleman Bastards), and 'The Priory of the Orange Tree' by Samantha Shannon.

'The Priory of the Orange Tree' is set in a world where the threat of dragons looms, and the balance of power between various kingdoms is at stake, with multiple protagonists.

'The Lies of Locke Lamora' has a faster pace and a more witty, dialogue-driven style, while 'The Priory of the Orange Tree' has a slower pace, with more detailed world-building and character development. Some critics have found elements of 'The Priory of the Orange Tree' to be dense, and some have found elements of 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' to be too reliant on plot twists, but both are considered excellent. It's a matter of preference!",
