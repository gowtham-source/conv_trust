While I don't have real-time data on the ethical practices of all manufacturers, I can suggest brands that are known for their commitment to sustainability and ethical sourcing. Look into brands like Veja (as previously mentioned), Allbirds, and Thousand Fell. Before purchasing, I highly recommend checking the company's website for detailed information on their materials, manufacturing processes, and labor practices. You can also look for certifications like B Corp.",
