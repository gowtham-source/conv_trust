For protein, eggs and canned beans are very budget-friendly. You could also look for chicken thighs, which are often cheaper than breasts. Does that sound good so far?",

      "utterance": "That's a good question! Flexibility is key. If your preferred items are too expensive, look for alternatives within the same food group. For example, if chicken thighs are pricey, try lentils as a protein source. Also, consider frozen vegetables, which are often cheaper than fresh and last longer. And always check the unit price â€“ sometimes a larger package is actually cheaper per serving, even if the upfront cost is higher. Finally, plan simple meals that use the same ingredients in multiple ways to reduce waste.",
