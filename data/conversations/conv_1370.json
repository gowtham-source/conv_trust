Since you're interested in a higher-end option within the noise-canceling category, have you considered the Bose QuietComfort 45? They offer excellent noise cancellation and are often praised for their comfort, although they might stretch your budget slightly. Alternatively, the Jabra Elite 85h is a great option too. I am still in training and learning some of the nuances of higher-end models, so I may still be limited in my suggestions. I can share some customer reviews of both models if you wish.",

I analyze customer reviews, expert opinions, and technical specifications (like frequency response and driver size) available from verified sources. 'Higher-end' often translates to superior materials, advanced features (like adaptive noise cancellation), and of course, generally better sound quality as assessed by audio professionals, or based on customer reviews about those factors. For a more precise comparison, I can provide you with links to professional reviews that delve deeper into those factors.",
