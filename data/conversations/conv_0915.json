They often feature premium materials like leather or suede, and come in neutral colors like black, brown, or navy. They aim for a refined aesthetic that bridges the gap between casual and formal footwear. Many brands offer them; you could search for 'leather sneakers' to see examples.",

Good pairings include chinos or dark-wash jeans with a blazer or a smart sweater. Color coordination is also important - ensure the sneaker color complements the overall outfit.",
