For example, are you interested in a specific technology (like AI, web development, etc.) or a particular theme (like sustainability, healthcare, etc.)? Also, what is your current experience level with coding and relevant technologies?",

Specifically, filter by 'AI/Machine Learning' and look for events that mention 'social good' or 'impact' in their descriptions. Also, many universities host hackathons with a focus on specific themes; searching for university-hosted AI hackathons may yield results. Finally, be mindful of the participation requirements to make sure you are eligible for the event.",
