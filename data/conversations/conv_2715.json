I cannot recall any well-known films that precisely match this description. Most thrillers use scores or source music conventionally. Films like 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' incorporate music into a non-conventional genre mix, but aren't primarily thrillers in the sense you described. It seems this might be a gap in existing film categories.",

Okay, fine, forget the musical part. Just focus back on the psychological thriller with unreliable narrators or reality-bending stuff. Anything new since 'Arrival' that fits that?",

For psychological thrillers with unreliable elements or reality distortion, focusing on the last few years, consider 'The Platform', 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things', or possibly 'The Invisible Man' (which plays with perception and control).
