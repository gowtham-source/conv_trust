My definitions are based on a combination of factors including instrumentation, lyrical themes, song structure, and historical context as determined by music databases and expert analyses. I also consider how frequently a piece of music is associated with a particular genre by listeners. It's not a perfect system, especially with cross-genre artists, but it aims to provide the most relevant recommendations based on available data. For dream pop, I'd suggest Mazzy Star or Beach House.",
