While that code often indicates a patient responsibility or coverage issue, Medicare absolutely covers medically necessary established patient visits like 99214. This rejection could be due to several reasons, potentially including incorrect patient demographic information submitted, a coordination of benefits issue if they have other insurance, or perhaps an issue with eligibility verification on the date of service. Have you double-checked the patient's eligibility and demographics against what was submitted on the claim?",
