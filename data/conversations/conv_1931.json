It's an epic fantasy series, but it has a unique magic system and a great heist-focused plot. For sci-fi, I'd suggest 'The Martian' by Andy Weir. It's not overly technical, focuses on problem-solving, and has a great sense of humor. How do those sound?",

But I can give you one suggestion based on some quick research, it's called 'The Broken Earth' trilogy by N. K. Jemisin. I'm still learning and my information isn't perfect but I hope this will get you started! Let me know if you'd like more recommendations!",
