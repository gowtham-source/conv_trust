Some common causes include insufficient sleep, poor diet, stress, and underlying medical conditions.

Both diet and exercise play significant roles, and it's difficult to quantify precisely without additional information. Some signs could point to nutritional deficiencies, like feeling weak, dizzy, or experiencing frequent headaches. These could possibly stem from an iron or vitamin D deficiency, for instance. However, it's essential to consult a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and tailored advice. They can review your medical history, conduct a physical examination, and order tests if necessary.",
