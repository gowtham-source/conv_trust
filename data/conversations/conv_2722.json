To investigate further, could you confirm the date of service and the patient's insurance policy details?",

While the patient might be enrolled (active), their specific plan may exclude certain types of visits or services, or have limitations. An eligibility check confirms enrollment but doesn't always detail every benefit exclusion. Typically, PR-204 points directly to a coverage issue rather than a need for more information.",

Appealing a PR-204 often involves verifying the patient's benefits specifically for that date of service and service type, and if you believe the denial is incorrect based on the plan documents, you would typically file an appeal referencing the specific benefit language you believe covers the service. Including medical necessity documentation might be helpful context in some cases, but the primary focus of the appeal would be on the coverage terms.",
