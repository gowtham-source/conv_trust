Once you've done that, you can proceed with the following steps: disconnect the old fixture (after taking a photo of the wiring!), connect the new fixture's wires to the existing wires using wire connectors (usually twist-on caps), and then mount the fixture to the ceiling.  Does that sound clear so far?",

Match the colors accordingly: black to black, white to white, and ground to ground. If the new fixture has a different wiring configuration or if you are unsure, it's best to consult with a qualified electrician. We would not want to give out unsafe electrical advice.",

      "utterance": "Hmm, that's an unusual situation but not unheard of, it depends on the age of the wiring. If the wires are all the same color, and you cannot tell which is the hot (power) wire, you'll need to use a multimeter to test the wires. Set the multimeter to AC voltage and touch the probes to each wire in turn. The hot wire will show a voltage reading, while the neutral wire will not (when the breaker is on). Be very careful doing this. It might be best to call an electrician at this point.",
