Generally, focusing on quality materials, classic silhouettes, and versatility is key. Avoid overly flashy details or anything too heavily branded. Read style blogs and observe what consistently looks good on well-dressed people over time. And most importantly, choose what makes you feel confident and comfortable \u2013 confidence is always stylish!
