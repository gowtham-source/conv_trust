As for waterproofing, while there's no guaranteed 'foolproof' method, a combination of a topical membrane like RedGard or AquaDefense *along* with a pre-sloped shower pan and proper drain installation is generally considered highly effective. Be sure to carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions for each product. Professional installation is also highly recommended for optimal results.",
