For example, you could say, 'I assisted in managing a budget of X, where I was responsible for tracking expenses, forecasting spending, and identifying cost-saving opportunities.' Highlight the impact of your contributions. Avoid exaggerating, but emphasize your relevant skills and willingness to learn.
