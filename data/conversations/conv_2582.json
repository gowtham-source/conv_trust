While testing it without specialized equipment is difficult, power adapter failures can occasionally happen, though they don't have a strict 'lifespan' like a battery. Since there are absolutely no lights on the router, even after a power cycle and confirming the outlet, it strongly suggests either the power adapter or the router's power circuitry has failed.
