However, films like 'Apollo 13' are praised for their commitment to portraying real-world events and challenges, even if they aren't strictly 'sci-fi' in the traditional sense. It depends what's 'accurate' in what you want. Do you want the laws of physics to be obeyed, or is it about future technology?",
