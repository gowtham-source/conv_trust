      "utterance": "That's a great question! Quality in leather sneakers is largely determined by the leather type (full-grain is best), the construction method (stitched soles are generally more durable), and the materials used in the insole and lining. Higher-quality sneakers will often have better support and a more comfortable fit. To identify quality, look for a smooth, consistent leather texture, reinforced stitching, and check the brand's reputation for craftsmanship. Brands like Common Projects or Greats are known for quality, but even some more affordable options from brands like Adidas or Nike can be good if you are selective about the material and construction.",
