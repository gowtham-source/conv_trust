Credit card debt is... embarrassing. Let's say $5,000 with a ridiculously high interest rate. I also have about $2,000 in a savings account. Is that enough info?",

      "utterance": "Okay, a lot of good questions! Both debt avalanche and debt snowball are methods to pay off debt with different strategies. Index funds and ETFs are both types of investment funds that can offer diversification and are generally considered suitable for long-term investing, and while no investment is entirely without risk, they are generally seen as safe. Given your current situation with high-interest debt, it's generally advisable to prioritize paying that down before heavily investing, as the interest savings will likely outweigh any investment gains in the short term. However, contributing a small amount to a retirement account, especially if your employer offers a match, could still be beneficial. Let's explore the debt snowball versus avalanche method first, and then we can discuss investment options further. We can also discuss risk tolerance if you'd like, because that is important to think about!",
