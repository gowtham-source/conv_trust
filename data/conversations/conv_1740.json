The first is a direct flight from JFK to Heathrow on September 10th, returning September 19th for $850. There's also a flight from EWR with a layover that is $600, and a flight from JFK that connects through Iceland for $700.",

I don't want to give you any incorrect information. I can provide links if you'd like.",
