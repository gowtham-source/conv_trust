After the flight booking, I can provide you with options for airport transfers to South Beach, including taxis, ride-sharing services, and public transportation. I can even provide estimated costs and travel times for each option. For the flights, I've found several options departing Chicago (ORD) on October 18th and returning from Miami (MIA) on October 22nd for two adults. The cheapest option is currently with Spirit Airlines for $250 per person, but I don't recommend it. Do you have any airline preferences, or would you like me to filter by price?",
