The Gilded Spoon serves modern American cuisine, and they also have some vegetarian options, although it can change. Let me quickly see... I am having a little trouble accessing real-time menu information right now. However, I'd suggest checking their websites. Alternatively, I can try finding reviews mentioning vegetarian dishes. Which would you prefer?",
