The New Balance Fresh Foam series is another great option. These are all neutral shoes, suitable for road running.

However, I can provide you with the Brooks size chart and direct you to resources on how to measure your feet at home. Also, many retailers offer a 'try before you buy' option, or offer free returns, which could help alleviate sizing concerns. Would you like me to provide links to the size chart and information about return policies from some of the retailers that sell Brooks Glycerin shoes?",
