While we strive for prompt handling, the timeframe for each claim can vary significantly based on complexity, the extent of the damage, and the volume of claims being processed. An 'initial decision or payout' depends on completing the full assessment, which includes reviewing documentation and potentially an adjuster's visit. There isn't a single 'average timeframe' I can provide that applies universally, as each case is unique. Your assigned adjuster will contact you directly as soon as they have specific information or need to schedule a visit.",
