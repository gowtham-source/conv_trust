      "utterance": "That's a valid point. Prioritizing competing financial goals can be tricky. One approach is to rank them based on urgency and impact. High-interest debt, like your credit card, often takes precedence to minimize interest charges. Saving for a down payment is also important, and we can explore high-yield savings accounts or other short-term investment options that align with your risk tolerance. As for the specific amounts, a common rule of thumb is the 50/30/20 rule: 50% of your income for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. However, this is just a guideline, and we can adjust it based on your specific circumstances and preferences.",
