It has a unique setting, though it is less fantasy and more... noir detective. I am less capable of providing specific game mechanics, but I recommend looking into 'Monster Hunter Stories 2' for a turn-based combat system. Further analysis, like recommending titles based on unique mechanics is outside my current skillset, however.",
