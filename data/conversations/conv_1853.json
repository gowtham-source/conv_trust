Kuang: A grimdark fantasy with a female protagonist and a fast-paced plot. Be warned, it's quite brutal!\n\nDo either of those sound interesting?

The world-building is revealed gradually through the characters' interactions and the unfolding story, making it more accessible. It\u2019s a complex world, but the story is the focus, making it a good choice for you. I think you'll enjoy it.",
