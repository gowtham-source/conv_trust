Without the model, specific instructions are tough, but generally, you'll need to disconnect the old faucet's water supply lines (turn off the water first!), unscrew the mounting hardware, and then remove the old faucet.  For the new faucet, you'll reverse the process. The most challenging part often is accessing the connections under the sink. What's the biggest problem you are facing right now?",
