A good rule of thumb is to tighten the screws until they are snug, but *not* over-tightened. You don't want to crack the sink. Usually, a couple of additional turns after it's snug is fine. If you have a torque wrench, consult the faucet's manual for the manufacturer's recommendations, but that's unlikely. If unsure, it's better to err on the side of less tightness. This avoids cracking the sink, so it\u2019s usually better to tighten it in small increments.",

You can usually find flexible supply lines with the correct connectors at your local hardware store. Always check your local plumbing codes for specific requirements.",
