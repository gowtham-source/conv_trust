      "utterance": "Certainly! First, we consider the vertical motion. We know the initial vertical velocity is 0 m/s (since it's thrown horizontally), the displacement is -10 m (downwards), and the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s\u00b2. Using the equation d = v\u2080t + (1/2)at\u00b2, we can solve for time (t). So, -10 = 0*t + (1/2)*(-9.8)t\u00b2. Solve for t, and you have the answer. Now, for a more challenging question, what if we consider air resistance?",
