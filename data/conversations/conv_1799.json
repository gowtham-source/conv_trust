We know the initial vertical velocity is 0 m/s (since it's thrown horizontally), the displacement is -10 m (downwards), and the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s². Using the equation d = v₀t + (1/2)at², we can solve for time (t). So, -10 = 0*t + (1/2)*(-9.8)t². Solve for t, and you have the answer. Now, for a more challenging question, what if we consider air resistance?",
