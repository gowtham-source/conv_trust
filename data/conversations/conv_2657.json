While I cannot provide specific clinical advice, payers often look for detailed progress notes that clearly outline the patient's symptoms, diagnosis, assessment, plan, and how the service aligns with accepted medical standards and the patient's condition on that specific date.

I recommend consulting with the provider or a coding specialist to ensure the documentation fully supports the necessity.",
