You play as a detective with amnesia, and the gameplay is heavily focused on dialogue and skill checks, rather than combat. The story is incredibly well-written, with a focus on philosophical themes and political intrigue. It's often praised for its writing, unique setting, and character development. It's also usually available at a lower price point than something like Baldur's Gate 3. Though honestly, the game is difficult to recommend broadly, given its niche audience.",
