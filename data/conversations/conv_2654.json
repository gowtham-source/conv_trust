Typically, a lease agreement is a legally binding contract that outlines the terms, including the rent amount, for the duration of the lease period. Changes to the lease usually require mutual agreement between both parties unless specifically allowed by a clause within the original lease or by local/state laws. Could you check your lease for any clauses about potential rent increases or unforeseen circumstances?",

My landlord is saying these 'unexpected costs' are due to property tax increases, which apparently happened recently. They insist this allows them to pass the cost onto tenants immediately, regardless of the lease. This doesn't sound right at all, but I'm not a lawyer, so I'm really confused and worried.",

      "utterance": "Thank you for providing those details. If your lease contract specifies a fixed rent amount for the entire term with no clause allowing for adjustments based on the landlord's costs, it is generally the case that the landlord cannot unilaterally increase the rent during the lease period. While property taxes or other costs may increase for the landlord, these are typically business risks that they cannot transfer to a tenant who is under a fixed-term lease unless the contract allows for it or there is specific local legislation permitting such adjustments under certain conditions. Documentation of your lease terms is very important here.",

      "utterance": "That's a critical question, and it touches upon lease enforcement and potential retaliation. Generally, a landlord cannot evict a tenant solely for refusing to pay an illegal rent increase that violates the terms of a valid lease. Eviction processes require specific legal grounds, such as non-payment of the agreed-upon rent, violation of lease terms, or other legally recognized reasons. Attempting to evict a tenant in retaliation for asserting their rights (like refusing an illegal rent hike) is illegal in many jurisdictions. However, proving retaliation can be complex, and navigating eviction proceedings requires understanding local tenant protection laws. Because this involves specific legal actions like potential eviction and contract enforcement, it falls outside the scope of general information an AI can provide. It would be prudent to consult with a landlord-tenant attorney or a tenant advocacy group in your area who can review your lease and advise you on the best course of action and your rights should the landlord pursue eviction.",
