Building a strong portfolio showcasing your skills, networking within the UX community, and highlighting transferable skills from your customer service background (such as communication, problem-solving, and user empathy) will significantly increase your chances. It's also about demonstrating a genuine passion for the field. It won't be easy, but it's definitely achievable with effort and persistence.
