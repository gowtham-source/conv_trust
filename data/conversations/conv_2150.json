Building a strong portfolio showcasing your skills, networking within the UX community, and highlighting transferable skills from your customer service background (such as communication, problem-solving, and user empathy) will significantly increase your chances. It's also about demonstrating a genuine passion for the field. It won't be easy, but it's definitely achievable with effort and persistence. Would you like me to research companies hiring junior UX writers to understand their requirements?",
