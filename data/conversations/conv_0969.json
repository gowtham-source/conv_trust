They often have affordable and stylish options. Look for basic t-shirts (around $10-$15 each), a couple of pairs of jeans (aim for $25-$40 each), and a sweater or two (around $20-$30 each). Don't forget to check their clearance sections for even better deals!",

Look for clothing with descriptions like 'relaxed fit' or 'A-line' which often flatter curvier figures. High-waisted jeans can also be very flattering for a shorter frame. Unfortunately, I can't provide personalized fitting advice without knowing your specific measurements, but focusing on fit details in product descriptions will help.",

Look for brands that prioritize fair labor practices and sustainable materials, even if they're slightly more expensive. Thrifting and buying secondhand clothing is also a fantastic option. You can find unique and stylish pieces at very low prices, and it's a much more sustainable choice. Consider exploring consignment shops or online marketplaces like Poshmark and ThredUp.
