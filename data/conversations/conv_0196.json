It's important to track where the rest of your money is going to fully assess your financial situation. Consider using a budgeting app or spreadsheet to monitor your spending for a month. This will give us a clearer picture of where you can potentially save. Would you like me to recommend some budgeting apps?",

These are tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Given your income and potential for future growth, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. You can contribute up to $6,500 in 2023. As for *where* to invest, that depends on your risk tolerance. A simple, low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500 is often a good starting point.
