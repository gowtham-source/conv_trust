You can usually find them at a significant discount - potentially $100-$300 off the newest model, depending on the configuration and retailer. Regarding battery life, it can vary widely based on usage, but generally, older XPS 13 models still offer decent battery life (around 6-8 hours of typical usage). Be sure to check specific reviews for the exact model year you're considering to confirm battery life estimates and other performance aspects. Also, a newer battery will perform better than one that is old. How much battery usage are you expecting?",
