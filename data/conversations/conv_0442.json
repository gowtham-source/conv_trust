It's a bit of an investment but consistently gets high ratings for durability and brewing quality. Alternatively, the Technivorm Moccamaster is another excellent, albeit more expensive, option known for its consistent brewing temperature and long lifespan. Do either of those sound interesting?",

While lifespan varies based on usage and maintenance, many users report it lasting 5-7 years with regular cleaning and descaling. User reviews often cite the durable burr grinder and overall construction as reasons for its longevity, though some report occasional issues with the pump after extended use. I can also show you reviews mentioning the lifespan if you'd like.",
