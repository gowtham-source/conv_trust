Given the 20% credit card interest rate versus a 4% employer match, the mathematically optimal approach is usually to prioritize paying off the high-interest debt first. Avoiding 20% interest offers a higher 'return' than the guaranteed 4% match. However, many people choose a hybrid approach: contribute just enough to get the full employer match (securing that 'free money'), and then put any extra funds towards aggressively paying down the high-interest debt. This balances capturing the match while still making significant progress on the debt. Once the high-interest debt is gone, you can significantly increase your retirement contributions.",
