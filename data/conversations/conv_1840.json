Verbally narrate your approach, assumptions, and any roadblocks you encounter. For the 'tell me about a failure' question, use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answer. Can you give me an example failure you've experienced at work, and I can assist you in crafting a STAR response?",

      "utterance": "That's a great question! When the failure isn't entirely your fault, you should still take ownership for what you *could* have done better. Acknowledge the contributing factors, but focus on your actions. For example, you could say, \"While there were initial misunderstandings of the requirements, *I* could have been more proactive in clarifying them through more frequent check-ins and validating my understanding with the client.\" You can still use the STAR method, but make sure you're highlighting what you learned, and how you would prevent a similar situation in the future.
