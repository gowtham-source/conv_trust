Examples include scope management, risk mitigation, and stakeholder communication. Frame your experience to show you understand the core principles of project management, regardless of the methodology. You can also explain your willingness to adapt and learn Waterfall methodologies. Consider mentioning specific tools (like MS Project) you're familiar with or willing to learn, if the job description mentions any.",
