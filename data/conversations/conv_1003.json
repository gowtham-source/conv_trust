A very rough estimate, assuming a 7% average annual return and a need to replace 80% of your current income, suggests you should aim to save approximately 15% of your income, or about $1125 per month. However, I recommend consulting with a qualified financial advisor for a more personalized plan.",

      "utterance": "It's understandable to feel that way. While starting early is generally advantageous due to the power of compounding, there are strategies to catch up. You could consider increasing your savings rate gradually over time, taking advantage of employer matching contributions if available, or exploring higher-risk investments with potentially higher returns (though this comes with increased risk). Additionally, any unexpected income, such as bonuses or tax refunds, could be directed towards retirement savings. We can explore these options in more detail during our next session.",
