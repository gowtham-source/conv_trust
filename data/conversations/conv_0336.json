Explain the situation, the available data, the missing information, and the risk assessment you performed. Highlight how you weighed the pros and cons, consulted with others (if applicable), and made the most informed decision possible given the circumstances. And, as before, emphasize what you learned and how you'd approach a similar situation differently in the future. Remember to showcase your critical thinking skills.",
