To address your Java experience, it's fine if the projects are older. The key is to emphasize what you *accomplished* using Java. Focus on quantifiable results wherever possible. For instance, instead of just saying \"Developed Java applications,\" try \"Developed and deployed three Java applications, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement.\" Or if the projects are really old and not relevant, I would not include them. I will also provide you with some bullet points that you can use or tweak. Please give me some time to edit your resume and provide feedback.",
