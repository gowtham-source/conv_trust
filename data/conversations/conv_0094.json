In terms of portability, the Flip 6 is significantly smaller and lighter. As for water resistance, the Motion Boom has an IPX7 rating (can be submerged in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes), while the Flip 6 has an IP67 rating (dustproof and can be submerged in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes). So, the Flip 6 offers slightly better dust protection. Does that help?",
