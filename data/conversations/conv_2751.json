For the absolute cheapest basic economy fares, a checked bag is typically an additional charge, often ranging from $30 to $60 per bag per flight segment within the US. However, this can change, and some airlines or fare types might include it. To get the precise cost, you would need to check the individual airline's website once you have a specific flight in mind.",
