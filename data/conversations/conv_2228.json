The specifics depend greatly on your location's employment laws, so I'm unable to give an exact probability of success. However, if you believe the termination was based on age discrimination, gathering evidence to support this claim is key, such as documenting any instances of ageist remarks or actions. I recommend speaking with a lawyer in your area to get more tailored advice. Would you like me to provide some links to legal aid resources?",

A lack of documentation makes it harder to prove your case, but your testimony, the testimony of any witnesses who observed or heard ageist behavior, and any circumstantial evidence can still be valuable. Remember, however, that the burden of proof is on you to demonstrate the discrimination occurred. I'll provide those links to legal aid now. [Links to Legal Aid Resources]",
