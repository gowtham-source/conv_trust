Okay, I can suggest the 'SoundWave Go' for $40. It's wireless, though the battery life and sound quality aren't as good as the SonicBliss. Alternatively, you could consider looking at wired headphones with a Bluetooth adapter if the budget is a major constraint. Would you like more details on the SoundWave Go or information on Bluetooth adapters?",
