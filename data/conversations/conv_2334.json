Great noise cancellation for the price, long battery life.\n*   **Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT:** Around $80. Solid sound quality and good battery.\n*   **Sony WH-CH710N:** Usually closer to the upper end of your budget ($100-150) depending on sales, with excellent noise cancellation from Sony. \n\nI'd recommend checking reviews for each to see which fits your priorities best. Do any of these sound appealing?",
