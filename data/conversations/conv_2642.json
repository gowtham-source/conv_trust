My recommendations are typically based on popularity within a genre, critical acclaim, and associations derived from large datasets of listener behavior. For more niche or newer indie alternative rock, I can try to dig deeper. Have you heard of bands like The 1975, Vampire Weekend, or perhaps Portugal. The Man?

Considering that, you might enjoy bands such as Car Seat Headrest (modern indie with a lo-fi influence), Pavement (classic slacker rock, influential to that era), or maybe even less known acts like Archers of Loaf or Superchunk from the Merge Records catalog. While Pavement and the latter two are older, they fit that specific sound profile well. Car Seat Headrest is more contemporary but shares some characteristics. Let me know what you think!",
