Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time, detailed nutritional information like average calorie counts or the ability to filter *all* menu items for low sodium across every restaurant's entire menu database. Nutritional information varies greatly by dish and preparation. Your best bet for specific dietary details would be to check 'The Daily Bowl's' official website or their page on the delivery app you plan to use, as they often list ingredients or nutritional facts there. I can provide a link if you'd like.",
